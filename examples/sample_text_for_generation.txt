SHIRLEY:
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.

JACK:
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!

STRIKER:
Elaine!

ELAINE:
Ted!

STRIKER:
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

ELAINE:
I just don't want to go over it any more.

STRIKER:
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.

ELAINE:
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.

STRIKER:
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?

ELAINE:
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!

STRIKER:
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner  talk it over.

ELAINE:
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.

STRIKER:
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.

ELAINE:
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?

STRIKER:
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.

ELAINE:
Your uwaru urecordu? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.

STRIKER:
You expect me to believe that?

ELAINE:
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.

STRIKER:
But if you'll just give me...

ELAINE:
It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.

MURDOCK:
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.

OVEUR:
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.

JACK:
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'

SHIRLEY:
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.

GIRL:
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.

SOLDIER:
You promise you'll write.

GIRL:
Every day.

RANDY:
FourteenB. It's halfway down on your right.

STRIKER:
Thank you.

SOLDIER:
Goodbye, darling.

GIRL:
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.

SOLDIER:
So long, darling. Goodbye. Take care of yourself.

GIRL:
Bill! Bill! Goodbye, Bill.

SOLDIER:
Goodbye, darling.

GIRL:
Goodbye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.

SOLDIER:
Goodbye, darling.

OVEUR:
Roger.

MURDOCK:
Huh?

OVEUR:
Roger.

MURDOCK:
Huh?

MURDOCK:
We have clearance, Clarence.

OVEUR:
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?

RANDY:
Do you feel all right, sir?

STRIKER:
Oh  I haven't flown for a long time.

ELAINE:
Ted, what are you doing here?

STRIKER:
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

ELAINE:
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.

MILTON:
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.

BERNICE:
That's very nice of you. Thank you.

BERNICE:
Ah, won't you sit down?

MILTON:
Thank you. Cream?

BERNICE:
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.

MILTON:
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?

BERNICE:
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?

MILTON:
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.

ELAINE:
What's the matter?

STRIKER:
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.

ELAINE:
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.

STRIKER:
I love you, Elaine.

ELAINE:
I love you.

ELAINE:
We have a visitor.

OVEUR:
Hello.

MURDOCK:
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?

OVEUR:
No, why don't you take care ot it?

ELAINE:
We'd better get back now.

OVEUR:
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.

JOEY:
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!

MURDOCK:
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the copilot.

JOEY:
You uareu Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!

MURDOCK:
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?

OVEUR:
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.

MURDOCK:
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.

MURDOCK:
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.

JOEY:
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.

MURDOCK:
Denver Control, this is Flight twozero niner intersecting Victor Airway seven ninerniner.

JOEY:
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.

MURDOCK:
We are turning left to a heading of zero ninerniner.

JOEY:
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.

MURDOCK:
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.

STRIKER:
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?

ELAINE:
I remember everything. All I have are memories.

ELAINE:
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.

STRIKER:
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.

ELAINE:
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!

ELAINE:
You got a telegram from headquarters today.

STRIKER:
Headquarters!? What is it?

ELAINE:
It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?

STRIKER:
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.

ELAINE:
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?

STRIKER:
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.

ELAINE:
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.

ELAINE:
What's his problem?

STRIKER:
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.

RANDY:
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?

STRIKER:
No. No thank you.

RANDY:
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?

MRS. HAMMEN:
I will, but Jim won't.

RANDY:
Excuse me, Sister?

SISTER ANGELINA:
Yes?

RANDY:
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...

SISTER ANGELINA:
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.

RANDY:
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.

SISTER ANGELINA:
Of course.

LISA:
Hi!

RANDY:
I'm Randy.

LISA:
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!

RANDY:
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.

LISA:
Oh, I'd love to.

RANDY:
Okay, this is one of my favorites.

OVEUR:
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.

ELAINE:
Who wants to be first?

STRIKER:
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we reenlist I'll teach them baseball!

ELAINE:
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home  to the plans we made before the war.

STRIKER:
A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.

SHIRLEY:
Oh, I can't stand it.

JACK:
What is it?

OVEUR:
Airsick?

ELAINE:
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.

OVEUR:
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.

ELAINE:
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?

DR. RUMACK:
That's right.

ELAINE:
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?

DR. RUMACK:
Yes. Yes, of course.

DR. RUMACK:
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.

ELAINE:
A hospital? What is it?

DR. RUMACK:
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.

ELAINE:
Certainly.

DR. RUMACK:
Captain, how soon can we land?

OVEUR:
I can't tell.

DR. RUMACK:
Can't you take a guess?

OVEUR:
Well...not for another two hours.

DR. RUMACK:
You can't take a guess for another two hours?

OVEUR:
No, I mean we can't ulandu for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!

OVEUR:
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?

DR. RUMACK:
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.

DR. RUMACK:
What was it we had for dinner tonight?

ELAINE:
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.

DR. RUMACK:
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.

DR. RUMACK:
What did he have?

ELAINE:
He had fish.

RANDY:
Yes?

MRS. HAMMEN:
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?

RANDY:
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing do you know what he had for dinner?

MRS. HAMMEN:
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?

RANDY:
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.

ELAINE:
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.

DR. RUMACK:
Let's see now. The copilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?

ELAINE:
He had fish, too.

ELAINE:
Just how serious is it, doctor?

DR. RUMACK:
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.

DR. RUMACK:
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?

ELAINE:
No.

DR. RUMACK:
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?

ELAINE:
Well...

ELAINE:
No. No one that I know of.

DR. RUMACK:
I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.

CAREY:
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.

MRS. KRAMER:
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.

MRS. KRAMER:
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.

CAREY:
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.

MRS. KRAMER:
Something about a plane with no pilot?

CAREY:
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.

MRS. KRAMER:
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.

CAREY:
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.

MRS. KRAMER:
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.

RANDY:
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...

STRIKER:
The cockpit? What is it?

RANDY:
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?

STRIKER:
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.

RANDY:
Would you go up, please?

STRIKER:
Both pilots!

DR. RUMACK:
Can you fly this airplane and land it?

STRIKER:
Surely you can't be serious.

DR. RUMACK:
I uamu serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?

STRIKER:
Well, I flew singleengine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...uallu utogetheru!!!

ELAINE:
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!

STRIKER:
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.

DR. RUMACK:
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.

STRIKER:
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.

ELAINE:
Rain.

STRIKER:
And a little ice.

ELAINE:
And a little ice!

STRIKER:
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

ELAINE:
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

STRIKER:
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.

ELAINE:
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.

JACK:
How ya doing, honey?

SHIRLEY:
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.

JACK:
Here.

MILTON:
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person  a very wonderful person  makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.

BERNICE:
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.

MILTON:
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you  why haven't you ever married?

BERNICE:
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.

MILTON:
I know the answer  Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.

BERNICE:
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.

MILTON:
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.

BERNICE:
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.

MILTON:
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'

DR. RUMACK:
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.

STRIKER:
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?

DR. RUMACK:
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?

STRIKER:
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?

DR. RUMACK:
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.

STRIKER:
Surely there must be something you can do.

DR. RUMACK:
I'm doing everything I can!  And stop calling me Shirley!

STRIKER:
Rats! I've lost number three.

ELAINE:
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?

STRIKER:
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.

ELAINE:
But Ted, you're the only...

STRIKER:
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.

STRIKER:
George Zipp said that?

DR. RUMACK:
And the last thing he said to me, Doc, he said, Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc, he said, but I won't smell too good. That's for sure.

STRIKER:
Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.

KRAMER:
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?

GUNDERSON:
Yes, Captain?

KRAMER:
Did you decide on a runway yet?

GUNDERSON:
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.

GUNDERSON:
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.

KRAMER:
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.

GUNDERSON:
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!

KRAMER:
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.

RANDY:
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.

STRIKER:
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.

ELAINE:
Ted...

STRIKER:
Yes?

ELAINE:
I wanted you to know  now  I'm very proud.

STRIKER:
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.

ELAINE:
The gear is down.

MILTON:
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?

BERNICE:
No. I'm all alone.

MILTON:
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.

BERNICE:
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.

GUNDERSON:
He's right on the heading.

KRAMER:
All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.

STRIKER:
See them, Elaine?

ELAINE:
Uhhuh.

KRUGER:
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of prelaunch testing.

COMMISSIONER:
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.

KRUGER:
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let umeu talk to them.

COMMISSIONER:
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.

COMMISSIONER:
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.

KRUGER:
Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER:
What?

KRUGER:
I just wish it was that simple.

SIMON:
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.

ELAINE:
Simon.

SIMON:
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the DenverChicago run.

ELAINE:
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.

SIMON:
Women uandu the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.

ELAINE:
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.

SIMON:
You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.

JIMMY:
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?

JOHN:
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.

PORTER:
You folks need any help?

STELLA:
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.

PORTER:
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?

STELLA:
Yes.

PORTER:
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.

STELLA:
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.

PORTER:
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.

STELLA:
Now he's DYINGing and wants to be buried on Mercury.

SIMON:
Frank's the best pilot in the program.

ELAINE:
I'm so excited, Simon.

SIMON:
I guess this is a first for you.

ELAINE:
No, I've been excited before.

TED:
Elaine.

ELAINE:
Te...!

TED:
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.

TED:
Are you on the Mercury mission?

SIMON:
That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.

TED:
It's got to be stopped!

ELAINE:
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.

TED:
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.

SIMON:
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.

TED:
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.

SIMON:
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.

TED:
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.

ELAINE:
Ted, what's wrong?

TED:
Ask Simon.

ELAINE:
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.

TED:
There's nothing wrong with me!

ELAINE:
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.

TED:
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!

SIMON:
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.

ELAINE:
Simon, why has he become so... so...

SIMON:
So mentally ill?

STELLA:
Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?

TED:
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.

STELLA:
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.

TED:
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?

STELLA:
Yes.  He's dying uandu wants to be buried on Mercury.

TED:
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.

STELLA:
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.

SIMON:
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.

ELAINE:
Don't be too long.

TED:
Elaine.

ELAINE:
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.

TED:
Elaine, what happened to us?

ELAINE:
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.

ELAINE:
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.

ELAINE:
Who's that, Ted?

TED:
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.

TED:
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.

ELAINE:
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.

TED:
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.

ELAINE:
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electroshock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.

TED:
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.

ELAINE:
If that's the way you want it.

TED:
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.

ELAINE:
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.

KRUGER:
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.

COMMISSIONER:
That just doesn't make any sense.

KRUGER:
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.

COMMISSIONER:
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...

KRUGER:
You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!

SIMON:
Captain Oveur?

OVEUR:
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.

SIMON:
We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.

SIMON:
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.

OVEUR:
Do you think it's necessary to explain ueverythingu?

TED:
I have to see Bud Kruger.

RECEPTIONIST:
Do you have an appointment, sir?

TED:
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.

RECEPTIONIST:
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.

TED:
All right, it's a matter of death.

RECEPTIONIST:
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.

RECEPTIONIST:
You can't go in there!

TED:
Don't try to stop me!

RECEPTIONIST:
But that's not a door.  The door's over there.

WIFE:
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.

JOE:
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...

WIFE:
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.

JOE:
I don't want to hear that word!

WIFE:
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.

JOE:
All right.  Here.

WIFE:
What...?

OVEUR:
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.

SIMON:
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.

DUNN:
Oveur.

OVEUR:
Dunn.

ELAINE:
Ted!  What are you...?

TED:
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.

ELAINE:
Ted, we're taking off!

TED:
Let me by, Elaine.

SIMON:
Whenever your're ready, Captain.

OVEUR:
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A okay up here and ready for countdown.

ELAINE:
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.

RUMACK:
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...

RUMACK:
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.

ELAINE:
What can uIu do, Doctor Rumack?

RUMACK:
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.

ELAINE:
I mean for Ted.

RUMACK:
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.

ELAINE:
Is that a good sign, Doctor?

ELAINE:
What are you doing, Ted?

TED:
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!

ELAINE:
Ted.

TED:
Not now, Elaine!

ELAINE:
Ted!

RUMACK:
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.

ELAINE:
Is he making any progress, Doctor?

RUMACK:
Yes  last week that pile of mud was only this high.

OVEUR:
Shut down accelerators.

DUNN:
Accelerators down.

OVEUR:
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.

ELAINE:
Yes, sir.

ELAINE:
Intermitant failure in scan mode R. Analyze.

ROK:
Negative.

ELAINE:
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.

ROK:
Negative.

ELAINE:
That's not possible.

ROK:
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.

SIMON:
Have you got it straightened out now?

ELAINE:
I think so.

SIMON:
That's my girl.

ROK:
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.

ELAINE:
That's okay, ROK.

ROK:
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?

ELAINE:
Go ahead.

ROK:
You have great tits.

ELAINE:
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.

SIMON:
Roger.

OVEUR:
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.

MARY:
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.

OVEUR:
No.  Poached.  Over.

MARY:
Poached uandu over, Captain Oveur?  Over.

OVEUR:
Just poached on toast.  Over.

OVEUR:
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.

MARY:
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.

OVEUR:
Poached!  Not over!  Over!

JIMMY:
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.

JOHN:
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.

JIMMY:
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?

JOHN:
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.

JOHN:
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.

JIMMY:
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?

JOHN:
Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!

DUNN:
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.

OVEUR:
You better check it, Unger.

TED:
Elaine.

ELAINE:
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.

TED:
Elaine, we have to go back.

ELAINE:
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.

TED:
Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.

ELAINE:
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.

TED:
Then you udou think I'm insane.

ELAINE:
I've never used the word insane, Ted.

TED:
What word would you use, Elaine?

ELAINE:
The word is sick.  Ted  very, very, very sick.

TED:
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.

ELAINE:
I'd use the word insane.

TED:
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.

ELAINE:
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.

STELLA:
You've been hurt.

TED:
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.

STELLA:
No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.

STELLA:
Do you want to talk about it.

TED:
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.

STELLA:
No.  I mean your relationship.

TED:
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.

STELLA:
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.

TED:
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.

STELLA:
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.

TED:
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.

STELLA:
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.

TED:
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.

STELLA:
No.  It's hard to LAUGH when your father's dying.

TED:
Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.

DUNN:
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.

OVEUR:
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.

OVEUR:
Dunn.

DUNN:
Sir?

OVEUR:
You better take this.

OVEUR:
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?

JIMMY:
Scraps.

OVEUR:
Can I hold him?

JIMMY:
Sure.

OVEUR:
He's a boy dog.

JIMMY:
Yeah.

OVEUR:
Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?

ELAINE:
Request comprehensive electrical systems check.

ROK:
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...

ELAINE:
Request life support systems check.

ROK:
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.

ELAINE:
Request selfanalysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.

ROK:
There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight  just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship  I've already proven uthatu.

DUNN:
Did you feel that?

MARY:
Yes I did...

DUNN:
Felt like a large asteroid.

MARY:
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?

DUNN:
What is it, Mary?

MARY:
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.

ELAINE:
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.

OVEUR:
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?

ELAINE:
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.

OVEUR:
Roger.

ELAINE:
You can do it from up here, Captain.

OVEUR:
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.

ELAINE:
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.

OVEUR:
Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.

MARY:
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.

OVEUR:
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?

ELAINE:
Simon, what's happening?!

SIMON:
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.

ELAINE:
Can't we change course?

SIMON:
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.

SIMON:
My career is shot.

ELAINE:
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?

SIMON:
Striker.

TED:
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?

SIMON:
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.

TED:
Then Elaine was right.

SIMON:
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!

TED:
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...

TED:
Elaine!

ELAINE:
Ted!

TED:
Elaine, what's going on?

ELAINE:
Ted, there's no time to explain.

KRUGER:
Forget it.  I was reading.

COMMISSIONER:
I was reading too.

KRUGER:
What's the story?

COMMISSIONER:
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...

KRUGER:
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.

TED:
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.

ELAINE:
Ted, please be careful.

KRUGER:
Kruger, Sagittarius.

COMMISSIONER:
Commissioner, Aquarius.

ELAINE:
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.

TED:
Not now, Elaine.

ELAINE:
I mean until we start to burn up.

TED:
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what  the prestige of your precious space program.

ELAINE:
That was very well put, Ted.

TED:
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.

ELAINE:
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.

TED:
That might be the news we've been waiting for.

TED:
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?

MARY:
Sixteen 'C', why?

TED:
He's carrying a bomb.

MARY:
A b...

TED:
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.

MARY:
What should I say?

TED:
Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.

TED:
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.

JOE:
I don't want to live anymore.

TED:
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.

JOE:
What?

TED:
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.

JOE:
You're sure?

TED:
I'm sure.

ELAINE:
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.

SIMON:
Maybe.

ELAINE:
Simon, what are you saying?!

ELAINE:
Simon just ejected!

TED:
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.

ELAINE:
You mean...

TED:
That's right  premature ejection.

ELAINE:
What will happen to him, Ted?

TED:
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.

TED:
Are you afraid?

ELAINE:
Not when I'm with you, Ted.

TED:
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.

TED:
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!

ELAINE:
Set!

TED:
Now!

ELAINE:
Compute!

ELAINE:
Ted, the lever!

TED:
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.

CORNELIUS WALDMAN:
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?

HERR FALKSTEIN:
I did, sir.

HERR FALKSTEIN:
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.

CORNELIUS WALDMAN:
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.

CORNELIUS WALDMAN:
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?

HERR FALKSTEIN:
'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'

ANASTASIA:
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman  excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?

CORNELIUS WALDMAN:
Yes, my dear, he is.

ANASTASIA:
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?

CORNELIUS WALDMAN:
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.

ANASTASIA:
Oh, shit.

CORNELIUS WALDMAN:
Herr Falkstein  you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.

CORNELIUS WALDMAN:
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Yes, sir.

CORNELIUS WALDMAN:
I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!

FREDDY:
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'

MEDICAL STUDENT:
I beg your pardon?

FREDDY:
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.

MEDICAL STUDENT:
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.

FREDDY:
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!

MEDICAL STUDENT:
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?

FREDDY:
That's true!  But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!

FREDDY:
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.

MEDICAL STUDENT:
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.

FREDDY:
Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?

FREDDY:
Where did you get this cauliflower?

CARLSON:
From your office, sir.

FREDDY:
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?

CARLSON:
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.

FREDDY:
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?

CARLSON:
No, sir.  It will never happen again.

FREDDY:
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.

FREDDY:
Give him an extra dollar.

CARLSON:
Yes, sir.

FREDDY:
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?

MEDICAL STUDENT:
Dr. Fronkonsteen!

FREDDY:
Yes?

MEDICAL STUDENT:
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?

FREDDY:
A piece of what?

MEDICAL STUDENT:
Vermicelli.

FREDDY:
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.

CARLSON:
Yes, sir.

FREDDY:
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm  with very few exceptions  is not a human being.

MEDICAL STUDENT:
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the reanimation of component parts?

FREDDY:
My father was a sick man.

MEDICAL STUDENT:
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?

FREDDY:
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.

MEDICAL STUDENT:
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?

FREDDY:
How old are you, young man?

MEDICAL STUDENT:
Nineteen, sir.

FREDDY:
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.

MEDICAL STUDENT:
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!

FREDDY:
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.

MEDICAL STUDENT:
But, sir...

FREDDY:
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.

FREDDY:
You have more chance of reanimating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,

MEDICAL STUDENT:
But your grandfather's work, sir...

FREDDY:
My grandfather's work was DooDoo! Dead is Dead!  There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!

FREDDY:
Carlson!

CARLSON:
Yes, sir?

FREDDY:
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.

CARLSON:
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?

FREDDY:
... No!

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Dr. Frankenstein?

FREDDY:
Fron kon steen!

HERR FALKSTEIN:
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.

FREDDY:
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?

FREDDY:
How long will this whole thing take?

HERR FALKSTEIN:
A week.  Ten days at most.

FREDDY:
I'll have to think it over.  It's not so easy just to pick up and...

FREDDY:
What's that tune that you're playing

OLD VIOLINIST:
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.

FREDDY:
How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.

FREDDY:
May I see your violin?

OLD VIOLINIST:
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?

FREDDY:
Oh, just a little.

FREDDY:
Nice!  Nice little balance to it.

OLD VIOLINIST:
Ja, ja.

FREDDY:
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Why did you do that?

FREDDY:
What?

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Break that old man's violin.

FREDDY:
I didn't do that.

HERR FALKSTEIN:
The old violinist  you smashed his violin over your knee.

FREDDY:
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Yes, sir.

FREDDY:
One week at the most!?

HERR FALKSTEIN:
One week  I'll see to it, sir.

FREDDY:
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Not at all  a great privilege, Doctor.

FREDDY:
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!

ELIZABETH:
Darling!...you will be careful!?

FREDDY:
Of course.

ELIZABETH:
You have your tickets?

FREDDY:
Yes.

ELIZABETH:
And your passport?

FREDDY:
Yes, don't worry.

ELIZABETH:
Call me from New York before you leave??

FREDDY:
Yes.

ELIZABETH:
Promise??

FREDDY:
I promise.

ELIZABETH:
Oh, darling  I'll count the hours that you're away.

FREDDY:
Oh, darling  so will I.

ELIZABETH:
Will you miss me?

FREDDY:
Very....very!

ELIZABETH:
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.

FREDDY:
Oh, nice.

ELIZABETH:
I hope you like large weddings.

FREDDY:
Whatever makes you happy.

ELIZABETH:
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.

FREDDY:
You're incorrigible!

ELIZABETH:
Does that mean you love me?

FREDDY:
You bet your boots it does.

FREDDY:
I will!  Goodbye, darling!

ELIZABETH:
Goodbye, darling.

ELIZABETH:
Goodbye, darling.

FREDDY:
Goodbye, darling!

IGOR:
Frederick Frankenstein?

FREDDY:
Fron kon steen!

IGOR:
Are you putting me on?

FREDDY:
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.

IGOR:
And do you also say Fro dereck?

FREDDY:
No, Fred ereck.

IGOR:
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?

FREDDY:
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.

IGOR:
I see.

FREDDY:
You must be Igor.

IGOR:
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.

FREDDY:
But they told me it was Ee gor.

IGOR:
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?

FREDDY:
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?

IGOR:
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.

FREDDY:
I'm sure we will.

IGOR:
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.

FREDDY:
How do you do?

INGA:
Extremely well.

FREDDY:
How nice.

IGOR:
Are these your bags?

FREDDY:
Yes, just the two.

INGA:
Did you have a pleasant trip?

FREDDY:
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.

INGA:
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?

FREDDY:
I'm not sure I...get your drift.

FREDDY:
Incidentally  I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.

IGOR:
What hump?

INGA:
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.

FREDDY:
Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.

IGOR:
There.

FREDDY:
I beg your pardon?

IGOR:
There wolf!  There castle!

FREDDY:
Why are you talking like that?

IGOR:
I thought you wanted to.

FREDDY:
No.

IGOR:
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.

FREDDY:
What wockers?

IGOR:
The wockers with the knockers.

FREDDY:
Wockers with the knockers???

IGOR:
Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.

IGOR:
Home!

FREDDY:
Home.

IGOR:
Down!  Get down, you beasts!

FREDDY:
I wonder what's got into them?

FRAU BLUCHER:
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.

FREDDY:
It seems fine.

FRAU BLUCHER:
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.

FREDDY:
Does that include the key to the laboratory?

FRAU BLUCHER:
You mean... the laboratory??

FREDDY:
Yes!... the laboratory.

FRAU BLUCHER:
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.

FREDDY:
May I have it, please?

FREDDY:
There seem to be quite a few books.

FRAU BLUCHER:
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.

FREDDY:
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?

FRAU BLUCHER:
I don't know what you mean, sir.

FREDDY:
well, there was a public and a private library  he said so in his will.  these books are all very general  any doctor might have them in his study.

FRAU BLUCHER:
This is the only library I know of.

FREDDY:
Surely he kept his notes  his private papers and records in some other place?

FRAU BLUCHER:
I think you must be mistaken, sir.

FREDDY:
Well... we'll see.

FRAU BLUCHER:
Will there be anything else?

FREDDY:
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?

FRAU BLUCHER:
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.

FREDDY:
Good.

INGA:
Are you busy?

FREDDY:
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?

INGA:
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.

FREDDY:
We only arrived a few minutes ago.

INGA:
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.

FREDDY:
Well...

INGA:
Oh please  just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.

FREDDY:
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.

FREDDY:
Would you like a sandwich?

INGA:
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.

FREDDY:
Well... I'll just finish unpacking.

FREDDY:
Inga!

INGA:
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.

FREDDY:
Inga, wake up!

INGA:
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?

FREDDY:
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?

INGA:
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?

FREDDY:
I don't know.  It just woke me up.

INGA:
Dr. Fronkonsteen  look!

FREDDY:
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.

INGA:
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.

FREDDY:
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!

FREDDY:
Ayegor!

IGOR:
Froderick!

FREDDY:
What are you doing here?

IGOR:
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.

FREDDY:
But what you were doing?

IGOR:
Just putting up some tea.

FREDDY:
Did you hear that strange music?

IGOR:
What?

FREDDY:
Did you hear that strange music??

IGOR:
What?

FREDDY:
Did you hear that strange music?

IGOR:
No, not sound.

INGA:
There must have been someone else down here then.

FREDDY:
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?

IGOR:
What?

FREDDY:
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?

IGOR:
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.

INGA:
Ooh!

FREDDY:
What a filthy mess.

FREDDY:
Did you see anyone else down here?

IGOR:
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.

INGA:
Look, Doctor!

FREDDY:
Well, this explains the music.

INGA:
But who was playing it?

FREDDY:
What is this place?

IGOR:
Must be the music room.

FREDDY:
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!

IGOR:
'How I Did It.'  Good title!

FREDDY:
Funny it should just be lying out here on the table.  I wonder what kind of dribble this is?

INGA:
Oh, doctor!

FREDDY:
Perhaps we'd better leave.

IGOR:
Taking the book along?

FREDDY:
Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.

FREDDY:
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.

INGA:
And look at this, Doctor!

FREDDY:
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'

IGOR:
His what??

INGA:
His schwanzstucker.

IGOR:
Whew!  A nineteeninch drill.

FREDDY:
What a filthy job!

IGOR:
Could be worse!

FREDDY:
How?

IGOR:
Could be raining!

FREDDY:
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!

IGOR:
I have a pretty good idea.

FREDDY:
Do you have the name I wrote down?

IGOR:
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.

FREDDY:
I want that brain.

IGOR:
Was he any good?

FREDDY:
Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.

IGOR:
Hmm!

FREDDY:
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.

IGOR:
That's not bad.

FREDDY:
Can you imagine that brain in this body?

IGOR:
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?

FREDDY:
He only died two weeks ago  I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.

IGOR:
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?

FREDDY:
Why?

IGOR:
It's always been one of my favorite names.

FREDDY:
If you like  just hurry!

IGOR:
Thank you, Master.

IGOR:
You're sure you know what you're doing?

FREDDY:
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!

IGOR:
Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios.

FREDDY:
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.

INGA:
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...

FREDDY:
A god?

INGA:
Yes!

FREDDY:
I know.

IGOR:
You'd better hurry  I think it's going to rain.

FREDDY:
All right... elevate me!

INGA:
Right here?

FREDDY:
Raise the platform, hurry!

INGA:
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.

FREDDY:
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.

IGOR:
Tonight?

FREDDY:
Yes!  When I give the word  throw the first switch!

IGOR:
You've got it, master.

FREDDY:
Throw the second switch!

IGOR:
This guy means business.

FREDDY:
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?

IGOR:
What?

FREDDY:
More, do you hear me?

IGOR:
What?

FREDDY:
Throw the third switch!

IGOR:
Wait till he sees the bill.

FREDDY:
Reputation.  Reputation!

INGA:
I thought it was wonderful.

FREDDY:
I don't understand  I followed the notes to the letter.

IGOR:
You can't win 'em all.

FREDDY:
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.

FREDDY:
Cold!  Cold and dead!

IGOR:
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.

FREDDY:
Don't try to cheer me up that way.

IGOR:
Well, I don't like to see you mope.

IGOR:
You'll be getting me sad next.

FREDDY:
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.

IGOR:
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.

FREDDY:
You're right!  Selfpity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.

FREDDY:
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.

IGOR:
Who are you talking to?

FREDDY:
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.

IGOR:
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound  I just asked what it was.

FREDDY:
But you did  I just heard it.

IGOR:
It wasn't me.

INGA:
It wasn't me.

FREDDY:
Look here   if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...

MONSTER:
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?

FREDDY:
It's alive!

INGA:
Oh, Doctor!

INGA:
I think you've done it, master.

FREDDY:
Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!

IGOR:
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.

FREDDY:
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.

FREDDY:
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.

IGOR:
Don't fall for that one.

FREDDY:
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk  pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.

IGOR:
careful, master  you never can tell with these chaps.

FREDDY:
Hello there.

MONSTER:
MMMMMmmmmmmm.

FREDDY:
How's everything?

MONSTER:
MMMmmmmmmmm.

FREDDY:
I'm going to untie you  can you understand that?

MONSTER:
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!

FREDDY:
Yes, I'm going to set you free.  Is the sedative ready?

FREDDY:
It's alive.  It's  moving! It's  breathing!  It's  standing!  What is your name?

MONSTER:
... It's.

IGOR:
Original.

FREDDY:
Give  me  your  hand!

FREDDY:
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.

IGOR:
You can say that again.

FREDDY:
Yes.

IGOR:
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.

FREDDY:
Why?

IGOR:
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.

FREDDY:
I'm not trying to be funny.

IGOR:
Repeat it anyway  it's a wonderful cue.

FREDDY:
... I'm glad that's...

IGOR:
No, no!  That whole thing!

FREDDY:
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.

FREDDY:
It looks that way.

INGA:
What do you think we should do?

IGOR:
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.

FREDDY:
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.

IGOR:
Yes, Master!

FREDDY:
Act casual!

INGA:
What are you going to do?

FREDDY:
I think I'll...carry him.

FREDDY:
Do you think you can sing it?

INGA:
Me?  Sing?

FREDDY:
Yes  quickly, dear!

INGA:
I'd be so nervous.

FREDDY:
This is not the finals  just sing!

INGA:
It's something daring, 'The Continental,' A way of dancing that's really ultra new It's very subtle, 'The Continental.'

INGA:
It has a passion, 'The Conti nental...'

FREDDY:
Stop  singing!!!

IGOR:
How's it going?

FREDDY:
What did you find out?

IGOR:
Someone was playing this in the music room.

FREDDY:
Where is he?

IGOR:
How do you know it was a 'he'?

FREDDY:
All right  where is she?

IGOR:
How do you know it was a 'she'?

FREDDY:
Bring  me  the  violin!

IGOR:
Can you play it?

FREDDY:
Maybe...if you get here on time.

INGA:
It's working!  Oh, Doctor  you play beautifully.

IGOR:
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?

FREDDY:
Get the sedative ready!

MONSTER:
MMmmm!  MMmmm!

FREDDY:
All right  give it to him!

INGA:
Are you serious??

FREDDY:
Give him the sedative!

INGA:
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.

FREDDY:
Did you do it?

INGA:
I think so.

FREDDY:
Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.

INGA:
I'm getting tired.

IGOR:
Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.

INGA:
Good night, Doctor.

FREDDY:
Good night!

FREDDY:
Thanks...for all your help.

IGOR:
That's what we're paid for.

MONSTER:
Poo  tmmm anngh ma Ritz!

FREDDY:
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................

MONSTER:
Poo  tmmm anngh ma Ritz!

FREDDY:
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.

MONSTER:
Soo  pah doo  per.

MONSTER:
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.

FREDDY:
...Super duper. Come let's mix where Rock efellers walk with sticks or 'umber ellas' in their mitts.........................

MONSTER:
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!

FREDDY:
For  God's sake  go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!

MONSTER:
MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!

FREDDY:
Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??

MONSTER:
MMMmmmmmm.

FREDDY:
Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer bloated bodies put together?

FREDDY:
I'm a failure.

IGOR:
Come on, Froderick  none of that.

INGA:
Look how far we've come.

IGOR:
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.

INGA:
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?

IGOR:
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?

FREDDY:
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?

FRAU BLUCHER:
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.

FREDDY:
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.

INGA:
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.

FREDDY:
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!

ELIZABETH:
Darling!

FREDDY:
Darling!

ELIZABETH:
Surprised?

FREDDY:
Surprised!

ELIZABETH:
Love me?

FREDDY:
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?

ELIZABETH:
Darling!?!

FREDDY:
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants  Inga and Ayegor.

IGOR:
Darling!

ELIZABETH:
Hello...?

IGOR:
Surprised?

ELIZABETH:
Well... yes.

IGOR:
Miss me?

ELIZABETH:
I...

FREDDY:
Ready, darling?

ELIZABETH:
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.

FREDDY:
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?

ELIZABETH:
What a strange fellow.

FREDDY:
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.

ELIZABETH:
Why does he call you 'master'?

FREDDY:
Are you suggesting I call him master???

ELIZABETH:
No, of course not.  I just meant...

FREDDY:
All right then!

MAITRE D':
Yes, sir, name, please?

MONSTER:
Food!

MAITRE D':
Do you have a reservation?

MONSTER:
Food!!

MAITRE D':
I'm sorry, sir.  We only seat by reservation.

MONSTER:
Drink!

MAITRE D':
Oh, no siree.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to maloo.

MONSTER:
Foooooood!

MAITRE D':
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?

MONSTER:
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!

MAITRE D':
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!

FREDDY:
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him  to control that body.

ELIZABETH:
Darling, you mustn't worry so.

FREDDY:
But there's a genius inside that body  crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to reestablish his communications system.

ELIZABETH:
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could  it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.

FREDDY:
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?

ELIZABETH:
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you  you need rest.

FREDDY:
I suppose you're right.

ELIZABETH:
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.

ELIZABETH:
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?

FREDDY:
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.

ELIZABETH:
Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything.

FREDDY:
I don't want to spoil anything  I just want to top it all off.

ELIZABETH:
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??

FREDDY:
That's a tough choice.

ELIZABETH:
Is it worth taking a chance?

FREDDY:
I suppose you're right.

ELIZABETH:
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.

FREDDY:
Good night.

ELIZABETH:
That's my good boy.

FREDDY:
Just passing through the night.

INGA:
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.

FREDDY:
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.

INGA:
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.

FREDDY:
It's terrible  the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?

INGA:
Not fooling around.

FREDDY:
I know, but I mean  not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?

INGA:
I see what you mean.

FREDDY:
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.

INGA:
I know Frederick.

FREDDY:
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.

INGA:
Of course not.

INGA:
What?

FREDDY:
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.

INGA:
Nor to Elizabeth.

FREDDY:
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.

INGA:
We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.

INGA:
And Elizabeth has hers.

FREDDY:
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.

INGA:
But, after all, you have yours.

FREDDY:
Yes, I have mine.

INGA:
And I have mine.

FREDDY:
Yes...yes, you have yours.

INGA:
Why don't we talk inside?

FREDDY:
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.

INGA:
Yes, I know.

FREDDY:
It wouldn't be fair to her.

INGA:
Yes, I know.

FREDDY:
You've got to help me to remain faithful.

INGA:
Yes, I will.

FREDDY:
...But an intellectual relationship, like this  we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day  anything!

BURGOMEISTER:
Frederick Frankenstein?

FREDDY:
You have the wrong house.

BURGOMEISTER:
And who might you be?

FREDDY:
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.

BURGOMEISTER:
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?

FREDDY:
No!

BURGOMEISTER:
What was your grandfather's name?

FREDDY:
Victor Frankenstein.

BURGOMEISTER:
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?

FREDDY:
Ugly, vicious rumous.

BURGOMEISTER:
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the Godfearing people of this village.  What say you to that?

FREDDY:
Poppycock!

FREDDY:
What monster?

IGOR:
What d'ya mean What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.

FREDDY:
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?

BURGOMEISTER:
Now wait a minute!

IGOR:
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.

FREDDY:
What???

IGOR:
He's carrying her off now through the woods.

FREDDY:
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...

IGOR:
That sound good, boss.

FREDDY:
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...

IGOR:
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?

FREDDY:
There's only one way.

IGOR:
I'll bet it's a doozy.

ELIZABETH:
What in God's name are you doing?

MONSTER:
Baack!

ELIZABETH:
What?

MONSTER:
Baack!

ELIZABETH:
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?

MONSTER:
MMMmmmm.

ELIZABETH:
All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.

MONSTER:
MMMmm!

ELIZABETH:
Is it that music?

MONSTER:
MMMMM!  MMMMM!

ELIZABETH:
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.

IGOR:
Come on, big fellow!

FREDDY:
Is everything ready?

IGOR:
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?

FREDDY:
It's the only way.

IGOR:
Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing.

IGOR:
How do you know they're done?

INGA:
The doctor said to allow seven minutes  no more and no less  or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.

IGOR:
How long is it so far?

INGA:
Four

IGOR:
Three minutes to go!

INGA:
Yes.

IGOR:
What d'ya want to do to kill time?

INGA:
Oh, Igor  I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.

INGA:
Igor  are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?

IGOR:
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.

m615:
INGA 

IGOR:
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right  Frau Blucher will show them in.

IGOR:
Oh, must be around ten... tenthirty.

INGA:
Igor  the clock!  Hurry!

IGOR:
Another fifteen seconds to go.

INGA:
Do Something!  Stall them!

ELIZABETH:
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poopoo undies.

MONSTER:
MMmmm.

ELIZABETH:
Still happy you married me?

MONSTER:
MMmmm.

ELIZABETH:
Love me oodles and oodles?

MONSTER:
MMmmm.

ELIZABETH:
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!

MONSTER:
MMmmm.

INGA:
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?

FREDDY:
MMmmm.

FREDDY:
MMMMmmmmm!

INGA:
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.

INGA:
Are you ready for me?

FREDDY:
MMMMmmmmm!

INGA:
Ready for Fuchsmachen???

FREDDY:
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!

INGA:
I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.

INGA:
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???

FREDDY:
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!

TRUMAN:
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...irisks?i...  ...sure I'm aware of the riskswhy else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?

MERYL:
Truman, you're gonna be late!

TRUMAN:
What's that?

MERYL:
It's a surprise.

MERYL:
Well, what do you think?

TRUMAN:
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.

TYRONE:
How's it going, Truman?

TRUMAN:
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.

TYRONE:
Good.  Good.

TRUMAN:
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?

TYRONE:
I'd ask for identification.

TYRONE:
See you tomorrow, Truman.

TRUMAN:
You can count on it.

MERYL:
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a Chef'sMate.  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.

TRUMAN:
Gee, that's great.

TRUMAN:
How did it go today?

MERYL:
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.

MERYL:
I was hoping we could have a special evening.

TRUMAN:
I won't be late.

MERYL:
Did something happen today?

TRUMAN:
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.

MARLON:
Yeah?  Outta what?

TRUMAN:
Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...iout!i

TRUMAN:
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.

MARLON:
So when are you leaving?

TRUMAN:
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...

MARLON:
Nursery?

TRUMAN:
iSpare roomi  I can start thinking about selling up...and I'll be gone.  Up and away on that big steel bird.  I'm going, don't you worry about that.

MARLON:
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.

TRUMAN:
Yeah, what happened?

MARLON:
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the Burbank name.

TRUMAN:
You think so?

MARLON:
Trust me.

TRUMAN:
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?

MARLON:
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you  you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?

TRUMAN:
I can't tonight.

MERYL:
Where have you been?

TRUMAN:
I've been thinking

MERYL:
Oh, God.

TRUMAN:
I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.

MERYL:
Every time you and Marlon

TRUMAN:
We could bum around the world for a year on that.

MERYL:
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.

TRUMAN:
Maybe I feel like a teenager.

MERYL:
We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments.  Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?

TRUMAN:
It'd be an adventure.

MERYL:
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?

TRUMAN:
That can wait.  I want to get away.  See some of the world.  Explore.

MERYL:
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.

TRUMAN:
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.

GUARD 1:
How can they have a child?

GUARD 2:
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.

GUARD 1:
Why not?

GUARD 2:
You think she'd go through with it?

GUARD 1:
Sure she would.

GUARD 2:
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.

TRUMAN:
How are you, Mother?

MOTHER:
Well, I made it through another night.

TRUMAN:
How's your hip?

MOTHER:
Oh, just so.

MOTHER:
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.

TRUMAN:
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.

MOTHER:
You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?

TRUMAN:
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?

MOTHER:
I feel certain my condition runs in the family.  Can't this wait, dear?

MOTHER:
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a weekin a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.

TRUMAN:
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.

MOTHER:
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.

TRUMAN:
They never found Dad's bodymaybe somehow

MOTHER:
Darling

TRUMAN:
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?

MOTHER:
You know he was an only child, like you.  I know how bad you feel about what happenedsailing into that storm.  But I don't blame you, Truman.  I never have.

MERYL:
What're you doing down here?

TRUMAN:
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.

MERYL:
I know.

TRUMAN:
How do you know?

MERYL:
Your mother called.  You shouldn't upset her like that.

TRUMAN:
What did you want?

MERYL:
I made macaroni.

TRUMAN:
I'm not hungry.

DAUGHTER:
What's he doing?

MOTHER:
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.

DAUGHTER:
The memory of who?

MOTHER:
Shhh!

MERYL:
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?

TRUMAN:
I still want to look over a couple of things.

TRUMAN:
You take Japanese.

LAUREN:
Oh, yes.

TRUMAN:
Lauren, right?

LAUREN:
That's right.  Lauren.

TRUMAN:
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank

LAUREN:
I'm not allowed to talk to you.

TRUMAN:
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.

LAUREN:
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.

TRUMAN:
You have a boyfriend?  Of course you do.

LAUREN:
No...I, er.

TRUMAN:
No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?

LAUREN:
No.

TRUMAN:
Saturday?

TRUMAN:
Actually, I'm free Sunday.

LAUREN:
Now.

TRUMAN:
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.

LAUREN:
If we don't go now, it won't happen.

LAUREN:
Well, what do you want to do?

TRUMAN:
I think I've studied enough.

LAUREN:
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?

TRUMAN:
I...I can't.

SYLVIA:
They're coming.  Any minute.

TRUMAN:
Who?

SYLVIA:
They're going to stop me talking to you.

TRUMAN:
There's no one here.

SYLVIA:
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan

TRUMAN:
How do you know about that?

SYLVIA:
And your teacher said, You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore.

TRUMAN:
Were you therehow do you know?

SYLVIA:
It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.

TRUMAN:
I don't understand.

SYLVIA:
You must listen.  Everybody's pretending, Truman.

DAUGHTER:
But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?

MOTHER:
Because his mother got sick  very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.

DAUGHTER:
I can't believe he married Meryl on the rebound.

TRUMAN:
Marlon

MARLON:
Truman, what are you doing here?

TRUMAN:
I've got to talk to you.

MARLON:
Sorry, I'm way behind.

TRUMAN:
I'm onto something, Marlon  something big.

MARLON:
Are you okay?  You look like shit.

TRUMAN:
I think I'm mixed up in something.

MARLON:
iMixed up?i  Mixed up in what?

TRUMAN:
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening  elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?

MARLON:
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...

TRUMAN:
I think it's got something to do with my dad.

MARLON:
Your Dad?!

TRUMAN:
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.

MARLON:
Who?

TRUMAN:
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.

MARLON:
How about them?

TRUMAN:
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?

MARLON:
I told you I can't.

TRUMAN:
I've got to show you something.

MARLON:
What're we doing here, Truman?

TRUMAN:
This is where it started.

MARLON:
What exactly?

TRUMAN:
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?

MARLON:
No.

TRUMAN:
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?

MARLON:
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.

TRUMAN:
Yeah...

MARLON:
That's the Big Guy.  Quite a paintbrush he's got.

TRUMAN:
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.

MARLON:
Really?

TRUMAN:
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.

MOTHER:
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Trumanwhen Dad was still with us  that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.

TRUMAN:
It looks so small.

MOTHER:
Things always dowhen you look back.

MERYL:
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?

TRUMAN:
Good night, Mother.

MERYL:
See you in a minute, sweetheart.

TRUMAN:
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.

MERYL:
I'm sorry, I'm late.

TRUMAN:
What's the hurry?

MERYL:
Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Nonunion contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.

TRUMAN:
Arrah!

MERYL:
Oh, my God!

TRUMAN:
What do I do?

MERYL:
I don't know

TRUMAN:
you're a nurse, aren't you?

MERYL:
Put some butter on itor ice?

TRUMAN:
I'm looking for my wifeNurse Burbank. It's important.

NURSE:
I'm afraid that's impossibleshe's in preop.

TRUMAN:
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?

NURSE:
I'll try.

TRUMAN:
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.

NURSE:
When you get to Fiji?

TRUMAN:
You got it.

NURSE:
Fine.  I'll tell her.

AGENT:
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?

TRUMAN:
I want to book a flight to Fiji.

AGENT:
Where exactly?

TRUMAN:
iFiji.i

AGENT:
iWherei in Fiji?  What island?

TRUMAN:
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.

AGENT:
Viti Levu.  For how many?

TRUMAN:
One.

AGENT:
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?

TRUMAN:
Today.

AGENT:
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.

TRUMAN:
iA month.i

AGENT:
It's the busy season.

TRUMAN:
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  Doris?  Your job is to help people travel.

AGENT:
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.

TRUMAN:
Why wouldn't I?

AGENT:
I thought you were in a hurry.

TRUMAN:
That's right.

AGENT:
You want to book the flight?

TRUMAN:
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.

MERYL:
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me

TRUMAN:
I won't be here Sunday.

MERYL:
we need more charcoal.

TRUMAN:
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?

MERYL:
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji.  Is that it?

TRUMAN:
Let's go now.

MERYL:
What?!

TRUMAN:
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?

MERYL:
You hate gambling.

TRUMAN:
That's right.  I do, don't I?

MERYL:
So why do you want to go?

TRUMAN:
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?

MERYL:
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.

TRUMAN:
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?

MERYL:
You blaming me for the traffic?

TRUMAN:
Should I?

MERYL:
Truman, that was our house!

TRUMAN:
I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.

MERYL:
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!

TRUMAN:
I think I'd like a little company.

TRUMAN:
It's hard to go places, isn't it?

MERYL:
There's been an accident, Truman.

TRUMAN:
Uhuh.  There's no accident.  It's just more stalling.

MERYL:
Truman, I took the hypocrite oath!

TRUMAN:
I bet you did.

MERYL:
Truman, what about that sign?

TRUMAN:
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.

MERYL:
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?

TRUMAN:
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.

MERYL:
So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea?  I'd better call your mother when we get there.  She'll be worried sick  I don't know how she's going to take this.

TRUMAN:
Now what?

OFFICER:
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.

TRUMAN:
Is there any way around?

OFFICER:
The whole area's being evacuated.

TRUMAN:
Well, thank you for your help.

OFFICER:
You're welcome, Truman.

MERYL:
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.

TRUMAN:
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.

MERYL:
That's not true.

MERYL:
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners

TRUMAN:
What the hell are you talking about?!

MERYL:
I've tasted other cocoas.  This is the best.

TRUMAN:
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!

MERYL:
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.

TRUMAN:
You're part of this, aren't you?!

TRUMAN:
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.

MERYL:
Do something...

TRUMAN:
Who were you talking to?!

MERYL:
You're the one talking to the walls!

TRUMAN:
No.  You said, Do something.  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!

MERYL:
Truman, stop it!

TRUMAN:
Stay where you are!

MARLON:
Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.

TRUMAN:
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.

MARLON:
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on Seahaven Tonight?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?

TRUMAN:
This is different.  Everybody seems to be in on it.

MARLON:
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no iit.i

TRUMAN:
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head?

MARLON:
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.

TRUMAN:
What's that?

MARLON:
The thing that started all of this.

SIMEON:
Close up?

CHRISTOF:
No, hold back...

INTERVIEWER:
Welcome.

CHRISTOF:
Thank you.

INTERVIEWER:
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.

CHRISTOF:
We ihavei had our close calls in the past.

INTERVIEWER:
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this  the first time an intruder has been a former cast member

CHRISTOF:
a dead one at that.

INTERVIEWER:
and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.

CHRISTOF:
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.

INTERVIEWER:
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince himwas it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?

CHRISTOF:
That and a fat, new contract.

INTERVIEWER:
How idoi you intend to explain his twenty two year absence?

CHRISTOF:
Amnesia.

INTERVIEWER:
Of course.

INTERVIEWER:
Let's talk ratings.  Truman has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few dayshow do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?

CHRISTOF:
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.

INTERVIEWER:
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twentyfour hours a day  eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?

CHRISTOF:
It has to be the reality.

CHRISTOF:
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.

INTERVIEWER:
A window onto the human condition?

CHRISTOF:
I prefer to think of it as a mirror.

CHRISTOF:
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.

INTERVIEWER:
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?

CHRISTOF:
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?

INTERVIEWER:
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.

INTERVIEWER:
Are we talking Emmies?

CHRISTOF:
Certainly a nomination.

INTERVIEWER:
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.

CHRISTOF:
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.

INTERVIEWER:
Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with master videographer, Christof.

INTERVIEWER:
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.

CHRISTOF:
Let me demonstrate some examples.

CHRISTOF:
He was curious from birth  premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.

INTERVIEWER:
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.

CHRISTOF:
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies  the casting of a show determined by an air date  he was the one who arrived on cue.

INTERVIEWER:
Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year  Bringing Up Baby  would turn into a cradle to grave concept.  He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.

CHRISTOF:
That's correct.

INTERVIEWER:
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.

CHRISTOF:
People forget it takes the ipopulationi of an entire country to keep the show running.

INTERVIEWER:
No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.

CHRISTOF:
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale  from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in

INTERVIEWER:
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.

CHRISTOF:
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.

INTERVIEWER:
And it's all available in the Truman Show catalogue.  Operators are standing by.

INTERVIEWER:
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?

CHRISTOF:
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven  demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.

INTERVIEWER:
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameoplaying a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?

CHRISTOF:
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.

INTERVIEWER:
The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them.  Hollywood, California, you're on Tru Talk.

CHRISTOF:
We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public.

INTERVIEWER:
Let's take another call.  London, England, you're on Tru Talk.

TRUMAN:
What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid  only I'm not going idowni the Yuba, I'm going iup.i  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?

MERYL:
Truman, you're gonna be late!

CHRISTOF:
Why is he in the basement?

SIMEON:
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.

CHRISTOF:
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?

SIMEON:
What's to see?

CHRISTOF:
What's on the ClockCam?

CHRISTOF:
What happened down there?

SIMEON:
He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But halfway through, he gave up and fell asleep.

CHRISTOF:
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.

SIMEON:
He gave it back to his father.

SIMEON:
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.

CHRISTOF:
All prop cars accounted for?

SIMEON:
He has to be on foot.  He has the world's most recognizable face.  He can't disappear.

SIMEON:
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.

CHRISTOF:
What have we missed?

SIMEON:
It's just a matter of time.

CHRISTOF:
We're not watching the sea.

SIMEON:
Why would we

CHRISTOF:
Sweep the harbor.

CHRISTOF:
Cue music...

SIMEON:
What music?

CHRISTOF:
iStormi music...Wagner...

SIMEON:
He doesn't care.

CHRISTOF:
Do it!

TRUMAN:
Who are you?

CHRISTOF:
I'm the creator.

TRUMAN:
The creator of what?

CHRISTOF:
A show  that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.

TRUMAN:
iA show.i  Then who am I?

CHRISTOF:
You're the star.

TRUMAN:
Nothing was real.

CHRISTOF:
iYoui were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch.

TRUMAN:
I have a map.

CHRISTOF:
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door

TRUMAN:
You never had a camera in my head.

DONNIE:
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.

ROSE:
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.

ELIZABETH:
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.

ROSE:
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.

SAMANTHA:
When can I squeeze one out?

DONNIE:
Not until like... eighth grade.

ROSE:
Excuse me?

ELIZABETH:
Donnie? You're a dick.

DONNIE:
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.

ELIZABETH:
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.

DONNIE:
You're such a fuckass.

ROSE:
When did you stop taking your medication?

ELIZABETH:
Did you just call me a fuckass?

ROSE:
That's enough.

ELIZABETH:
You can suck a fuck.

DONNIE:
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?

ROSE:
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.

ELIZABETH:
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?

ROSE:
How did you know 

ELIZABETH:
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.

ROSE:
It is a big deal.

ELIZABETH:
I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.

ROSE:
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?

DONNIE:
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.

ROSE:
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.

DONNIE:
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?

ROSE:
Our son just called me a bitch.

EDDIE:
You're not a bitch.

ROSE:
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.

EDDIE:
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...

SAMANTHA:
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.

DONNIE:
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.

SAMANTHA:
I'm telling Mom.

ROSE:
What?

EDDIE:
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?

ROSE:
He was a year ahead of us?

EDDIE:
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.

RONALD:
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!

DONNIE:
We went to a hotel.

RONALD:
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?

DONNIE:
I don't wanna talk about it.

DONNIE:
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?

SAMANTHA:
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.

RONALD:
Chut up!

SEAN:
Go back to China, bitch!

MS. POMEROY:
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?

DONNIE:
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.

EDDIE:
So how was school today?

DONNIE:
It was great. We had peanutbutter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during showand tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.

EDDIE:
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.

DONNIE:
Do they know yet?

EDDIE:
Know what?

DONNIE:
Where it came from?

EDDIE:
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.

DONNIE:
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?

EDDIE:
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.

EDDIE:
Oh, shit!

DONNIE:
Grandma Death.

DR. THURMAN:
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.

DONNIE:
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.

DR. THURMAN:
All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald.

DONNIE:
So, I met a new friend.

DR. THURMAN:
Would you like to talk about this friend?

DONNIE:
His name is Frank.

DR. THURMAN:
Frank.

DONNIE:
I think he saved my life.

DR. THURMAN:
How so?

DONNIE:
Don't you watch the news?

DR. THURMAN:
I don't own a television.

DONNIE:
A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.

DR. THURMAN:
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.

DONNIE:
He said to follow him.

DR. THURMAN:
Follow him where?

DONNIE:
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.

DR. THURMAN:
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?

DONNIE:
No.  That's stupid.

DONNIE:
The Last Unicorn! By Samantha Darko.

SAMANTHA:
Donnie! Give it back!

RONALD:
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.

SEAN:
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 755.

RONALD:
There's no rule!

SEAN:
Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.

SEAN:
All right! 755. Everybody goes home.

RONALD:
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.

LEROY:
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.

PRINCIPAL COLE:
What else?

LEROY:
What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.

PRINCIPAL COLE:
Christ. Is that an axe?

LEROY:
Yep.

PRINCIPAL COLE:
How did this happen?

LEROY:
I guess they made him do it.

DONNIE:
Hey...

GRETCHEN:
Hey...

DONNIE:
School's cancelled.

GRETCHEN:
Wanna walk me home?

DONNIE:
Sure.

GRETCHEN:
Don't look so freaked.

DONNIE:
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.

GRETCHEN:
Fuck them.

DONNIE:
So... you just moved here?

GRETCHEN:
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.

DONNIE:
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?

GRETCHEN:
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.

DONNIE:
Wow. Did he go to jail?

GRETCHEN:
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.

DONNIE:
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.

GRETCHEN:
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.

DONNIE:
What makes you think I'm not?

GRETCHEN:
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.

DONNIE:
That's easy. Antiseptics.

DONNIE:
I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.

GRETCHEN:
You mean soap?

DONNIE:
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.

GRETCHEN:
Wonder where we'll be then.

DONNIE:
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.

GRETCHEN:
Until it withers away.

DONNIE:
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.

GRETCHEN:
Why is that?

DONNIE:
We never would have had this conversation.

GRETCHEN:
You're weird.

DONNIE:
I'm sorry.

GRETCHEN:
That was a compliment.

DONNIE:
Will you go with me?

GRETCHEN:
Where are we going?

DONNIE:
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.

GRETCHEN:
Sure.

DONNIE:
Where are you going?

GRETCHEN:
I'm going home.

DR. THURMAN:
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?

DONNIE:
Yes.

DR. THURMAN:
So, tell me about your day, Donald.

DONNIE:
I met a girl.

DR. THURMAN:
What is her name?

DONNIE:
Gretchen. We're going together now.

DR. THURMAN:
Do you think a lot about girls?

DONNIE:
Yes.

DR. THURMAN:
How are things going at school?

DONNIE:
I think about girls a lot.

DR. THURMAN:
I asked you about school.

DONNIE:
I think about... fucking a lot during school.

DR. THURMAN:
What else do you think about during school?

DONNIE:
I think... about... Who's the Boss?

DR. THURMAN:
Who is the boss?

DONNIE:
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.

DR. THURMAN:
What about your family, Donnie?

DONNIE:
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!

DR. THURMAN:
Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.

RONALD:
What is this shit?

SEAN:
Raspberry.

RONALD:
Wicked.

SEAN:
No more fuckin' for her.

RONALD:
Smurfette doesn't fuck.

SEAN:
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.

RONALD:
Not Vanity. He's a homo.

RONALD:
How old is Grandma Death?

DONNIE:
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.

DONNIE:
How can you do that?

FRANK:
I can do anything I want... and so can you...

PRINCIPAL COLE:
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...

MS. FARMER:
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parentteacher bridge.

PRINCIPAL COLE:
Kitty...

MS. FARMER:
The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.

MS. FARMER:
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!

PRINCIPAL COLE:
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...

MS. FARMER:
I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.

DONNIE:
Why did you make me flood the school?

FRANK:
We just want to guide you in the right direction.

DONNIE:
Who is... we?

FRANK:
You'll know soon enough.

DONNIE:
Where did you come from?

FRANK:
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?

ROSE:
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.

MS. FARMER:
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.

ROSE:
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?

MS. FARMER:
I think we've all seen Bonanza.

GRETCHEN:
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?

DONNIE:
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.

GRETCHEN:
My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.

DONNIE:
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.

GRETCHEN:
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?

DONNIE:
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.

GRETCHEN:
And you'd never been there before?

GRETCHEN:
Donnie?

DONNIE:
Yeah?

GRETCHEN:
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?

DONNIE:
Why?

GRETCHEN:
Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.

MS. POMEROY:
Who is Frank?

DONNIE:
A sixfoottall bunny rabbit.

DONNIE:
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.

MS. FARMER:
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.

DONNIE:
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.

MS. FARMER:
The Lifeline is divided that way.

DONNIE:
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.

MS. FARMER:
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.

DONNIE:
Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.

DONNIE:
People aren't that simple.

MS. FARMER:
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.

ROSE:
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.

MS. FARMER:
Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.

DONNIE:
Dr. Monnitoff?

DR. MONNITOFF:
Donnie.

DONNIE:
I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?

DR. MONNITOFF:
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of spacetime.

DONNIE:
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light 

DR. MONNITOFF:
Theoretically.

DONNIE:
 and be able to find one of these wormholes.

DR. MONNITOFF:
A wormhole with an EinsteinRosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.

DONNIE:
So... that's it?

DR. MONNITOFF:
The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.

DONNIE:
Like a DeLorean.

DR. MONNITOFF:
A metal craft of any kind.

DONNIE:
It's called The Philosophy of Time Travel.

ELIZABETH:
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?

DONNIE:
Guess who wrote it?

DONNIE:
Grandma Death.

ROSE:
That is a terrible nickname.

EDDIE:
Grandma Death.

DONNIE:
You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.

EDDIE:
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.

DONNIE:
I guess she just lost faith in the world.

DR. THURMAN:
How many times have you seen Frank?

DONNIE:
Four times... so far.

DR. THURMAN:
Can anyone else see him?

DONNIE:
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.

DR. THURMAN:
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?

DONNIE:
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.

DR. THURMAN:
A sign from whom?

DONNIE:
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.

DR. THURMAN:
How does that make you feel?

DONNIE:
It reminded me of my dog Callie.

DR. THURMAN:
Is Callie still around?

DONNIE:
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...

DR. THURMAN:
Do you feel alone right now?

DONNIE:
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?

DR. THURMAN:
No. That makes you keep searching.

SETH:
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?

DONNIE:
I didn't say shit.

SETH:
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.

DONNIE:
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.

SETH:
You know what? I think that you did it.

GRETCHEN:
What happened to your neck?

DONNIE:
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?

GRETCHEN:
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.

DONNIE:
Why not just buy your baby a night light?

GRETCHEN:
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.

DONNIE:
With, like, images?

GRETCHEN:
Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.

DONNIE:
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...

GRETCHEN:
And what?

DONNIE:
Well...

GRETCHEN:
You want to kiss me...

DONNIE:
That's alright... I understand.

GRETCHEN:
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...

DONNIE:
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.

GRETCHEN:
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.

ELIZABETH:
So I hear you have a girlfriend.

DONNIE:
Yeah.

ELIZABETH:
What's her name?

DONNIE:
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?

ELIZABETH:
Why would I tell Mom?

DONNIE:
Because you tell Mom everything.

ELIZABETH:
No I don't.  She worries about you.

DONNIE:
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.

ELIZABETH:
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.

DONNIE:
I was just being honest.

ELIZABETH:
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.

DONNIE:
Her name is Gretchen.

ELIZABETH:
That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.

ROSE:
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...

DR. THURMAN:
What I think is going on with your son.

ROSE:
Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.

DR. THURMAN:
Has your son ever told you about Frank?

ROSE:
Come again?

DR. THURMAN:
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?

ROSE:
Frank?

DR. THURMAN:
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.

ROSE:
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?

DR. THURMAN:
He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind.

ROSE:
I... What can we do?

DR. THURMAN:
I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.

ROSE:
If that's what you think is necessary.

DR. THURMAN:
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.

JIM CUNNINGHAM:
Good morning, mongrels!

AUDIENCE:
Good morning...

JIM CUNNINGHAM:
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, Good morning!

AUDIENCE:
Good MORNING!

JIM CUNNINGHAM:
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!

AUDIENCE:
GOOD MORNING!

JIM CUNNINGHAM:
Are you AFRAID?

AUDIENCE:
GOOD MORNING!

JIM CUNNINGHAM:
Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of selfdoubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and diseasespreading behaviour.

DONNIE:
We're moving through time.

GRETCHEN:
What?

DONNIE:
How much are they paying you to be here?

JIM CUNNINGHAM:
Excuse me? What's your name, son?

DONNIE:
Gerald.

JIM CUNNINGHAM:
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.

DONNIE:
Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!

JIM CUNNINGHAM:
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.

DONNIE:
Well, I think you're the fucking AntiChrist.

DONNIE:
They suspended me for two days.

GRETCHEN:
Are you okay?

DONNIE:
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messedup stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?

GRETCHEN:
Who?

DONNIE:
The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.

GRETCHEN:
Oh, yeah.  The Philosophy of Time Travel. What is this?

DONNIE:
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?

DONNIE:
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.

GRETCHEN:
Maybe she's asleep.

DR. THURMAN:
And they grow out of our stomachs?

DONNIE:
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...

DR. THURMAN:
What did you find?

DONNIE:
Nothing.

DR. THURMAN:
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?

DONNIE:
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...

DR. THURMAN:
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?

DONNIE:
You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself.

DONNIE:
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.

DR. THURMAN:
I know.

DONNIE:
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.

DR. THURMAN:
The good stuff.

DONNIE:
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.

DR. THURMAN:
Have you ever made love, Donald?

ROSE:
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from afterschool activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?

DONNIE:
Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.

DONNIE:
So, we call them... IMGs.

GRETCHEN:
Infant Memory Generators.

DONNIE:
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.

GRETCHEN:
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.

DR. MONNITOFF:
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?

DONNIE:
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.

DR. MONNITOFF:
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.

FRANK:
I want to show you something.

DONNIE:
You have to do something for me first.

FRANK:
You have a request?

DONNIE:
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.

FRANK:
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?

DONNIE:
Take it off. I want to see you.

DONNIE:
What happened to your eye?

FRANK:
I am so sorry.

DONNIE:
Why do they call you Frank?

FRANK:
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.

DONNIE:
How much longer is this gonna last?

FRANK:
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.

GRETCHEN:
What? How long was I asleep?

DONNIE:
The whole movie. Let's go.

EDDIE:
Who's been giving you weird looks?

DONNIE:
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.

EDDIE:
You're my only son...

DONNIE:
I know, Dad.

EDDIE:
I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them.

DR. MONNITOFF:
Each vessel travels along a vector path through spacetime... along its centre of gravity.

DONNIE:
Like a spear.

DR. MONNITOFF:
Beg pardon?

DONNIE:
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?

DR. MONNITOFF:
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.

DONNIE:
Could these wormholes appear in nature?

DR. MONNITOFF:
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.

DONNIE:
If God controls time... then all time is predecided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.

DR. MONNITOFF:
I'm not following you.

DONNIE:
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?

DR. MONNITOFF:
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all preformed destiny would end.

DONNIE:
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...

DR. MONNITOFF:
Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.

MS. POMEROY:
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.

DONNIE:
Why should we care?

MS. POMEROY:
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.

DONNIE:
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?

MS. POMEROY:
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?

DONNIE:
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.

DONNIE:
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?

GRETCHEN:
What's wrong with you?

DONNIE:
What do you mean?

MS. FARMER:
Rose.

ROSE:
Kitty...

MS. FARMER:
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.

ROSE:
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddieporn dungeon.

MS. FARMER:
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.

ROSE:
Beg pardon?

MS. FARMER:
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.

ROSE:
But now you can't go.

MS. FARMER:
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.

ROSE:
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so lastminute... Eddie is in New York...

MS. FARMER:
Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.

ROSE:
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.

DONNIE:
Do you get to meet Ed?

ROSE:
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.

DONNIE:
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?

ROSE:
It feels wonderful.

ROSE:
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...

ELIZABETH:
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.

DONNIE:
Will you please talk to me?

GRETCHEN:
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.

DONNIE:
Then when? I have to talk to you.

DONNIE:
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?

MS. POMEROY:
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?

DONNIE:
Where are you going?

MS. POMEROY:
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.

DONNIE:
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.

MS. POMEROY:
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.

DONNIE:
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?

MS. POMEROY:
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.

DONNIE:
What's Cellar Door?

MS. POMEROY:
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that Cellar Door is the most beautiful.

DONNIE:
Cellar door.

MS. POMEROY:
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.

MS. POMEROY:
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?

DONNIE:
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.

MS. POMEROY:
Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.

DR. THURMAN:
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?

DONNIE:
Yes.

DR. THURMAN:
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?

DONNIE:
I... I was playing with fire.

DR. THURMAN:
Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?

DONNIE:
People get hurt.

DR. THURMAN:
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.

DONNIE:
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.

DR. THURMAN:
But you were punished.

DONNIE:
Yes. I went to jail.

DR. THURMAN:
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?

DONNIE:
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.

DR. THURMAN:
What did you want for Christmas that year?

DONNIE:
Hungry Hungry Hippos.

DR. THURMAN:
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?

DONNIE:
Regret.

DR. THURMAN:
What else makes you feel regret?

DONNIE:
That I did it again.

DR. THURMAN:
You've done it again?

DONNIE:
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.

DR. THURMAN:
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?

DONNIE:
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...

DR. THURMAN:
If God exists?

DONNIE:
I think now that he might...

DR. THURMAN:
Why?

DONNIE:
Because I'm so horny.

DR. THURMAN:
God exists because you're horny.

DONNIE:
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.

DR. THURMAN:
Where are we going?

DR. THURMAN:
Where are we going, Donald?

DONNIE:
I have the power to build a time machine.

DR. THURMAN:
How is that possible?

DONNIE:
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.

DR. THURMAN:
Then how is time travel possible?

DONNIE:
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.

DR. THURMAN:
When will this happen?

DONNIE:
Soon. Time is almost up.

DR. THURMAN:
What is going to happen?

DONNIE:
Frank is going to kill.

DR. THURMAN:
Who is he going to kill?

DONNIE:
I can see him right now!

DR. THURMAN:
Where is he, Donald?

DONNIE:
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.

DR. THURMAN:
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.

DONNIE:
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.

DR. THURMAN:
You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.

DR. THURMAN:
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.

DONNIE:
Thank you.

DR. THURMAN:
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.

DONNIE:
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.

DR. THURMAN:
Goodbye, Donald.

ELIZABETH:
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.

DONNIE:
Congratulations.

DONNIE:
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.

ELIZABETH:
Okay, but it has to be a small one.

DONNIE:
Everything is going to be just fine.

SEAN:
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.

RONALD:
I stole four beers from my dad.

GRETCHEN:
Hey.

DONNIE:
Hey. You OK?

GRETCHEN:
My mom is gone.

DONNIE:
Where is she?

GRETCHEN:
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.

DONNIE:
But you're OK?

DONNIE:
Did you call the cops?

GRETCHEN:
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.

GRETCHEN:
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.

DONNIE:
It's safe here.

GRETCHEN:
What?

DONNIE:
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.

DONNIE:
Come with me.

GRETCHEN:
Where are we going?

DONNIE:
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.

GRETCHEN:
Why? Is this about the book?

DONNIE:
No. Frank.

GRETCHEN:
Who's Frank?

GRETCHEN:
Is that a cellar door?

DONNIE:
Yeah...

DONNIE:
Dea ex machina...

SETH:
What did you say?

DONNIE:
Our saviour...

RONALD:
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!

DONNIE:
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.

GRETCHEN:
Hi... what's going on here?

DAVID:
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.

GRETCHEN:
What happened?

DAVID:
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.

GRETCHEN:
What was his name?

DAVID:
Donnie. Donnie Darko.

DAVID:
I feel bad for his family.

GRETCHEN:
Yeah.

DAVID:
Did you know him?

MRS. BEAUMONT:
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.

JEFFREY:
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.

MRS. BEAUMONT:
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.

JEFFREY:
Mom.

MRS. BEAUMONT:
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?

JEFFREY:
This is it.

JEFFREY:
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.

AUNT BARBARA:
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?

JEFFREY:
Yeah. How's Dad?

MRS. BEAUMONT:
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.

JEFFREY:
Be right down.

JEFFREY:
What time are visiting hours?

MRS. BEAUMONT:
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 1030. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over I need the car this morning.

JEFFREY:
Well. Okay.

MRS. BEAUMONT:
Jeffrey, when you see your father.

JEFFREY:
Yeah?

MRS. BEAUMONT:
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.

JEFFREY:
What?

MRS. BEAUMONT:
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.

JEFFREY:
Thanks a lot, Mom.

MRS. BEAUMONT:
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.

AUNT BARBARA:
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.

JEFFREY:
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.

JEFFREY:
Hi Dad.

MR. BEAUMONT:
Hey Jeff.

JEFFREY:
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.

MR. BEAUMONT:
Uhuh.

JEFFREY:
Are you feeling okay?

MR. BEAUMONT:
Uhuh.

MR. BEAUMONT:
Good to see you, son.

JEFFREY:
It's good to see you, Dad.

JEFFREY:
Are you Detective Williams?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Yes.

JEFFREY:
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont  I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont  Beaumont's Hardware Store?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?

JEFFREY:
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
You did? A human ear?

JEFFREY:
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?

JEFFREY:
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.

JEFFREY:
I'm going out for awhile.

MRS. BEAUMONT:
Do you want the car?

JEFFREY:
No, I'm just gonna walk around.

MRS. BEAUMONT:
Alright.

AUNT BARBARA:
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?

JEFFREY:
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.

JEFFREY:
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?

MRS. WILLIAMS:
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?

JEFFREY:
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.

MRS. WILLIAMS:
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?

JEFFREY:
Alright.

MRS. WILLIAMS:
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.

JEFFREY:
Yeah, I know.

MRS. WILLIAMS:
Would you like a piece of cake?

JEFFREY:
No. No thank you.

MRS. WILLIAMS:
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.

JEFFREY:
Yeah. okay.

SANDY:
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.

MIKE:
Yeah, nice meetin' you.

MRS. WILLIAMS:
He comes over to study.

JEFFREY:
Yeah.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Come into the study a minute.

JEFFREY:
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.

JEFFREY:
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.

JEFFREY:
It must be great.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.

JEFFREY:
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.

MRS. WILLIAMS:
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.

JEFFREY:
Say goodnight to Sandy.

JEFFREY:
Yeah, how did you know?

SANDY:
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.

JEFFREY:
Oh yeah?

SANDY:
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?

JEFFREY:
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.

SANDY:
Am I bothering you?

JEFFREY:
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?

SANDY:
Yes.

JEFFREY:
How is Central these days?

SANDY:
Terrible boring.

JEFFREY:
What else is new? Right?

SANDY:
Yeah. What are you doing now?

JEFFREY:
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.

SANDY:
That's too bad.

JEFFREY:
What do you know about the ear? Anything?

SANDY:
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?

JEFFREY:
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?

SANDY:
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.

JEFFREY:
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?

SANDY:
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.

JEFFREY:
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?

SANDY:
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.

JEFFREY:
The ear is from a missing person maybe?

SANDY:
Maybe so.

JEFFREY:
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?

SANDY:
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.

JEFFREY:
I guess you have to get back home soon?

SANDY:
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.

SANDY:
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.

JEFFREY:
Where are they?

SANDY:
I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.

JEFFREY:
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?

SANDY:
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.

JEFFREY:
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?

SANDY:
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.

JEFFREY:
You really do hear a lot, don't you?

SANDY:
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?

JEFFREY:
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.

SANDY:
Still, it must be kinda rough.

JEFFREY:
It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.

SANDY:
What happened to him?

JEFFREY:
I don't know. He moved away.

SANDY:
I've gotta go in.

JEFFREY:
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.

JEFFREY:
I guess I'll see you sometime.

SANDY:
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.

JEFFREY:
Yeah. Good bye.

JEFFREY:
You hungry or thirsty, or both?

SANDY:
I don't know.

JEFFREY:
I'd like to talk to you about something.

SANDY:
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.

JEFFREY:
I don't want to cause any trouble.

SANDY:
I'm here, aren't I?

JEFFREY:
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.

SANDY:
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.

SANDY:
Alright, now tell me. What is it?

JEFFREY:
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.

SANDY:
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.

JEFFREY:
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?

SANDY:
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.

JEFFREY:
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.

SANDY:
Now, how are you going to do that?

JEFFREY:
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.

SANDY:
What will I say when she comes to the door?

JEFFREY:
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few Awake magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?

SANDY:
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.

JEFFREY:
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.

SANDY:
You've got a point there.

JEFFREY:
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?

SANDY:
Alright.

JEFFREY:
Let's go.

JEFFREY:
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?

SANDY:
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.

JEFFREY:
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.

SANDY:
Alright. Good luck, yourself.

DOROTHY:
Yes? What is it?

JEFFREY:
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.

DOROTHY:
Oh God, that stuff stinks.

JEFFREY:
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.

DOROTHY:
Oh yeah, that's good.

JEFFREY:
That oughta do it.

DOROTHY:
Yeah.

SANDY:
Are you alright?

JEFFREY:
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?

SANDY:
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?

JEFFREY:
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?

SANDY:
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.

JEFFREY:
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?

SANDY:
Yeah, if it opens the door.

JEFFREY:
Yeah.

SANDY:
So, what's next?

JEFFREY:
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?

SANDY:
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.

JEFFREY:
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?

SANDY:
Yes. I do.

JEFFREY:
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.

SANDY:
You really want to do this, don't you?

JEFFREY:
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.

SANDY:
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?

JEFFREY:
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.

SANDY:
I already know. The Slow Club. It's on Route 7.

JEFFREY:
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?

SANDY:
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.

JEFFREY:
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.

JEFFREY:
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?

AUNT BARBARA:
I'm not sick.

JEFFREY:
Can I use the car tonight?

MRS. BEAUMONT:
Of course, Jeffrey.

SANDY:
What's the plan.

JEFFREY:
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.

SANDY:
Brilliant.

JEFFREY:
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.

SANDY:
This is not my usual Friday night!

SANDY:
That sounds good.

JEFFREY:
Two.

JEFFREY:
Here's to. An interesting experience.

SANDY:
I'll drink to that.

SANDY:
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.

JEFFREY:
Why not?

SANDY:
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.

JEFFREY:
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?

SANDY:
Yeah, but.

JEFFREY:
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?

SANDY:
OK.

JEFFREY:
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.

SANDY:
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.

JEFFREY:
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.

SANDY:
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.

JEFFREY:
Oh, okay, can I call?

SANDY:
Okay, yeah, call.

JEFFREY:
Look, it can wait till Sunday.

SANDY:
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?

JEFFREY:
Yeah.

SANDY:
I'm going to wait here until she comes.

JEFFREY:
Are you sure?

SANDY:
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?

JEFFREY:
Okay, thanks.

SANDY:
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.

JEFFREY:
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?

SANDY:
Okay, okay. Bye.

DOROTHY:
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees  DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

JEFFREY:
Jeffrey.

DOROTHY:
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?

JEFFREY:
Jeffrey nothing.

DOROTHY:
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?

JEFFREY:
I wanted to see you.

DOROTHY:
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?

JEFFREY:
Nobody.

DOROTHY:
Shit. You better tell me something.

JEFFREY:
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.

DOROTHY:
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.

JEFFREY:
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.

DOROTHY:
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.

JEFFREY:
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.

DOROTHY:
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.

JEFFREY:
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.

DOROTHY:
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?

JEFFREY:
Well.

DOROTHY:
THEN WHAT?

JEFFREY:
Then you got undressed.

DOROTHY:
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?

JEFFREY:
Never before this.

DOROTHY:
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.

JEFFREY:
No. Come on.

DOROTHY:
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.

JEFFREY:
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

DOROTHY:
No way.

DOROTHY:
What do you want from me?

JEFFREY:
I, I don't know.

DOROTHY:
What do you want?

DOROTHY:
Do you like that?

JEFFREY:
Yes.

DOROTHY:
Do you like talk like that?

JEFFREY:
No.

DOROTHY:
Lie down on the bed.

DOROTHY:
Hello, baby.

FRANK:
Shut up. It's daddy, shithead.

DOROTHY:
Hello, daddy.

FRANK:
My bourbon.

FRANK:
MOMMY!

DOROTHY:
Mommy's here.

FRANK:
Baby wants to fuck.

DOROTHY:
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?

JEFFREY:
Nothing. Are you alright?

DOROTHY:
Sure I'm alright.

JEFFREY:
I'll go then.

DOROTHY:
Don?

JEFFREY:
No.

DOROTHY:
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.

DOROTHY:
Thank you. honey.

JEFFREY:
It's okay. It's okay.

DOROTHY:
Do you like the way I feel?

JEFFREY:
Yes.

DOROTHY:
See my breasts? See?

JEFFREY:
Yes.

DOROTHY:
See my nipples?

JEFFREY:
Yes.

DOROTHY:
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.

DOROTHY:
You can hit me, if you want to.

JEFFREY:
No, please. I won't.

DOROTHY:
Do you like me?

JEFFREY:
Yes, I like you.

DOROTHY:
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.

DOROTHY:
I made it go down the toilet.

JEFFREY:
What?

JEFFREY:
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?

DOROTHY:
Do you know?

JEFFREY:
No.

DOROTHY:
You don't?

JEFFREY:
No. What is happening?

DOROTHY:
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.

JEFFREY:
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.

DOROTHY:
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.

JEFFREY:
Then don't talk about killing.

DOROTHY:
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.

JEFFREY:
Don't say that.

DOROTHY:
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.

JEFFREY:
OK.

JEFFREY:
God, you scared me.

MRS. BEAUMONT:
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?

JEFFREY:
Nothing. I'm fine.

MRS. BEAUMONT:
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.

JEFFREY:
Hi, can I come in?

DOROTHY:
Yeah, hurry up though.

DOROTHY:
Why are you here. Whatiya want?

JEFFREY:
I, uh.

DOROTHY:
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.

JEFFREY:
That's not crazy. I like you too.

DOROTHY:
I liked being with you last night.

JEFFREY:
Same here.

DOROTHY:
Oh shit.

JEFFREY:
Frank? Can you stand up?

DOROTHY:
I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.

YELLOW MAN:
Frank gone?

DOROTHY:
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.

YELLOW MAN:
Bull.

DOROTHY:
Alright, suit yourself.

YELLOW MAN:
He's comin' back? What for?

DOROTHY:
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.

YELLOW MAN:
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.

DOROTHY:
Oh he forced you, huh?

YELLOW MAN:
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin  let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.

DOROTHY:
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.

YELLOW MAN:
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.

JEFFREY:
Nice guy. Who's he?

DOROTHY:
Who's it, you mean.

DOROTHY:
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.

JEFFREY:
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.

DOROTHY:
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.

JEFFREY:
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?

DOROTHY:
Look.

JEFFREY:
No.

DOROTHY:
Falling.

JEFFREY:
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?

JEFFREY:
Who is Don?

DOROTHY:
Don? Are you in with them?

JEFFREY:
No. But you're in very big trouble.

DOROTHY:
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?

JEFFREY:
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?

DOROTHY:
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?

JEFFREY:
Yes.

DOROTHY:
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.

JEFFREY:
No. I should go.

DOROTHY:
Please, please stay.

JEFFREY:
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?

AUNT BARBARA:
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.

JEFFREY:
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?

AUNT BARBARA:
I've seen a few.

JEFFREY:
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.

AUNT BARBARA:
Okay honey.

JEFFREY:
No.

MIKE:
Looks like you'd make a good runner.

JEFFREY:
Well.

MIKE:
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.

JEFFREY:
No, you're right.

MIKE:
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.

JEFFREY:
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.

MIKE:
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?

MIKE:
What are watchin' this junk for?

SANDY:
You can change it if you want to.

MIKE:
I don't know why we have to watch TV.

SANDY:
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.

MRS. WILLIAMS:
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?

JEFFREY:
That sounds great!

MRS. WILLIAMS:
Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.

SANDY:
Well, how did it go? What happened?

JEFFREY:
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.

SANDY:
What did you see?

JEFFREY:
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?

MIKE:
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?

SANDY:
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.

MIKE:
Come on out a minute, okay?

SANDY:
Okay.

MRS. WILLIAMS:
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.

JEFFREY:
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?

MRS. WILLIAMS:
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Jeffrey?

JEFFREY:
Yes?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.

JEFFREY:
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Okay.

JEFFREY:
Anything you can tell me?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
The criminals are winning.

JEFFREY:
Is that why you say it's horrible?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Yes.

JEFFREY:
I guess you've seen some bad things.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Yes I have  so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.

JEFFREY:
Why do you do it?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.

JEFFREY:
Yeah. I get it.

JEFFREY:
What is this? What color is it?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.

JEFFREY:
What's with Mike?

SANDY:
He got a little jealous.

JEFFREY:
I'm sorry, I didn't...

SANDY:
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

SANDY:
You want a Dairy Queen?

JEFFREY:
No way. I'm about to blow up.

SANDY:
You want to tell me about it?

JEFFREY:
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the yellow man. You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.

SANDY:
Wow. Should you tell my father?

JEFFREY:
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.

SANDY:
You saw a lot in one night.

JEFFREY:
Actually. I've been in twice.

SANDY:
Twice. Without her sensing anything?

JEFFREY:
Yes.

SANDY:
Did you see her undressed?

JEFFREY:
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.

SANDY:
Yeah?

JEFFREY:
That doesn't bother you, does it?

SANDY:
Who, me? Why should it?

JEFFREY:
That's what I thought.

SANDY:
You're sure right. It is a strange world.

JEFFREY:
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?

SANDY:
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.

JEFFREY:
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.

SANDY:
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.

JEFFREY:
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.

SANDY:
No, silly  I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.

JEFFREY:
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirtyfive, okay?

SANDY:
Okay, be careful.

JEFFREY:
Okay, Sandy.

JEFFREY:
Can I give you a kiss good night?

SANDY:
You better not, Jeffrey.

JEFFREY:
Okay, okay.

SANDY:
Goodnight.

JEFFREY:
See ya tomorrow.

JEFFREY:
Hello?

FRANK:
Speak to me Fucker.

SANDY:
You were late.

JEFFREY:
I'm really sorry.

SANDY:
What am I going to do?

JEFFREY:
You want to go talk to him?

SANDY:
Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.

SANDY:
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.

JEFFREY:
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?

SANDY:
Shoot.

JEFFREY:
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?

SANDY:
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.

JEFFREY:
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.

SANDY:
Oh yeah?

JEFFREY:
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.

SANDY:
Jeffrey!!

JEFFREY:
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.

SANDY:
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?

JEFFREY:
Yeah.

SANDY:
Jeffrey? Why?

JEFFREY:
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.

SANDY:
You like mysteries that much?

JEFFREY:
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.

JEFFREY:
You worry about me really?

SANDY:
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.

DOROTHY:
Come in.

JEFFREY:
Hello.

DOROTHY:
It used to make me laugh, but.

JEFFREY:
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.

DOROTHY:
Yes. Frank

JEFFREY:
Frank is coming?

DOROTHY:
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.

JEFFREY:
I sure don't hate you.

DOROTHY:
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.

JEFFREY:
That's good.

DOROTHY:
Do you like my body?

JEFFREY:
Sure I do.

DOROTHY:
What do you want to do?

JEFFREY:
I'm doing it.

DOROTHY:
Are you a bad boy?

JEFFREY:
Whatiya mean?

DOROTHY:
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.

JEFFREY:
What do you want?

DOROTHY:
I want you to hurt me.

JEFFREY:
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.

DOROTHY:
No police!!!  No police!!

DOROTHY:
You like to open me, don't you?

JEFFREY:
Yes.

DOROTHY:
What if I told Frank that you opened me?

JEFFREY:
That wouldn't be too good, would it?

DOROTHY:
Frank would open you.

JEFFREY:
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.

DOROTHY:
Does that scare you?

JEFFREY:
Shut up.

DOROTHY:
Beeeee careful.

JEFFREY:
Come on Dorothy.

DOROTHY:
What if Frank came over here and found us?

JEFFREY:
Look, snap out of it, will ya?

DOROTHY:
Kiss me.

DOROTHY:
Do you love me?

JEFFREY:
Do you love me?

DOROTHY:
I asked first.

JEFFREY:
Sometimes I think I do.

DOROTHY:
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!

JEFFREY:
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!

DOROTHY:
Just get outta my bed.

DOROTHY:
I love you Don with all my heart.

JEFFREY:
No, it's not Don.

JEFFREY:
I didn't mean to hurt you.

DOROTHY:
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.

JEFFREY:
You what?

DOROTHY:
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.

JEFFREY:
There's no disease, I can tell you.

DOROTHY:
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?

JEFFREY:
I'm glad you do.

DOROTHY:
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.

JEFFREY:
Dorothy. No!

DOROTHY:
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.

JEFFREY:
You called me Jeffrey.

DOROTHY:
I did. Are you?

JEFFREY:
Yes.

DOROTHY:
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.

JEFFREY:
No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright.

JEFFREY:
I guess I should go.

DOROTHY:
I want you to stay with me.

JEFFREY:
I think I better go.

JEFFREY:
I'll call you.

DOROTHY:
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?

JEFFREY:
What?

DOROTHY:
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.

JEFFREY:
You look beautiful to me.

JEFFREY:
Oh no.

DOROTHY:
No.  Hi baby.

FRANK:
Who's this fuck?

DOROTHY:
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.

FRANK:
From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh? You wanta go for a ride?

JEFFREY:

FRANK:
No thanks. What does that mean?

JEFFREY:
I don't want to go.

FRANK:

JEFFREY:

FRANK:

FRANK:
Then, shut up!

FRANK:

JEFFREY:

FRANK:

DOROTHY:
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.

FRANK:
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?

DOROTHY:
Those are my breasts.

FRANK:
Can I feel 'em?

DOROTHY:
If you want to.

DOROTHY:
Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it.

FRANK:
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  Hey, pretty, pretty.

FRANK:
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?

JEFFREY:
Yes.

FRANK:
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!

JEFFREY:
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.

AUNT BARBARA:
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.

JEFFREY:
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.

JEFFREY:
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.

SANDY:
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me  you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.

JEFFREY:
Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Jeffrey! Come on in.

JEFFREY:
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.

JEFFREY:
Yeah.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Okay?

JEFFREY:
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.

JEFFREY:
And that man came out with a third man  this welldressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.

JEFFREY:
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?

JEFFREY:
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Is Sandy part of this?

JEFFREY:
No, not at all.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Who knows you have these?

JEFFREY:
Only you and the photo lab.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
You're all through with this now?

JEFFREY:
Yes sir. I sure am.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.

JEFFREY:
Yes sir.

SANDY:
Everything okay?

JEFFREY:
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?

SANDY:
You didn't tell him about me?

JEFFREY:
No.

SANDY:
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!

JEFFREY:
Okay. Great!

JEFFREY:
Okay.

SANDY:
What is it?

JEFFREY:
Just some fatherly advice.

SANDY:
What was that all about?

JEFFREY:
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.

SANDY:
It's good to see you.

JEFFREY:
Where to?

SANDY:
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?

JEFFREY:
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.

SANDY:
It's okay.

JEFFREY:
You look beautiful.

SANDY:
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?

JEFFREY:
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.

SANDY:
You want to dance?

JEFFREY:
I can't dance fast.

SANDY:
Really?

JEFFREY:
Really. You want to dance with someone else?

SANDY:
NO.

JEFFREY:
Let's wait for some slow one.

SANDY:
Just a minute.

JEFFREY:
You want to dance?

SANDY:
Okay.

SANDY:
Oh my God. What's wrong?

JEFFREY:
Frank!!!

JEFFREY:
My father has a gun at home.

SANDY:
No.

JEFFREY:
Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.

MIKE:
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.

SANDY:
Stop it Mike.

MIKE:
You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?

JEFFREY:
Dorothy!... Dorothy!

SANDY:
Dorothy Vallens?

JEFFREY:
Yes.

MIKE:
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!

JEFFREY:
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.

SANDY:
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?

JEFFREY:
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?

SANDY:
Probably not. No. Why?

JEFFREY:
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.

SANDY:
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.

JEFFREY:
Yeah, it's me.

DOROTHY:
Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.

DOROTHY:
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.

JEFFREY:
It's okay. It's okay.

DOROTHY:
My secret lover.

JEFFREY:
Sandy?... Sandy, please.

MRS. WILLIAMS:
I'll get a coat for her.

SANDY:
Jeffrey? What's going on?

JEFFREY:
Shhh. I'll tell you.

DOROTHY:
They hurt his head.

JEFFREY:
Who, Dorothy?

DOROTHY:
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!

JEFFREY:
I should go with her, Sandy.

SANDY:
Go ahead.

JEFFREY:
Sandy?

SANDY:
Go ahead!

DOROTHY:
Hold me, Don.

JEFFREY:
Don? Where is he?

DOROTHY:
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!

JEFFREY:
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.

DOROTHY:
Hold me. I'M FALLING!

JEFFREY:
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.

SANDY:
No Jeffrey!!

JEFFREY:
Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.

JEFFREY:
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?

JEFFREY:
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.

JEFFREY:
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Not yet.

JEFFREY:
Oh my God. Is her son OK?

F.B.I. MAN:
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?

JEFFREY:
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.

F.B.I. MAN:
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.

JEFFREY:
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?

F.B.I. MAN:
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.

JEFFREY:
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?

JEFFREY:
How ya doin' Dad?

MR. BEAUMONT:
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.

JEFFREY:
Good deal Dad.

SANDY:
Look Jeffrey.

JEFFREY:
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.

LEON:
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.

HOLDEN:
Don't move.

LEON:
Sorry.

LEON:
Already had I.Q. test this year  but I don't think I never had a...

HOLDEN:
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.

HOLDEN:
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...

LEON:
What one?

HOLDEN:
What?

LEON:
What desert?

HOLDEN:
Doesn't make any difference what desert  it's completely hypothetical.

LEON:
But how come I'd be there?

HOLDEN:
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself  who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...

LEON:
A tortoise.  What's that?

HOLDEN:
Know what a turtle is?

LEON:
Of course.

HOLDEN:
Same thing.

LEON:
I never seen a turtle.

LEON:
But I understand what you mean.

HOLDEN:
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.

LEON:
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?

HOLDEN:
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?

GAFF:
Where the hell you been?

DECKARD:
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.

GAFF:
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.

DECKARD:
What's up?

GAFF:
Holden got hit.

DECKARD:
Bad?

GAFF:
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.

DECKARD:
I'll see you in a minute.

DECKARD:
Six, huh?

BRYANT:
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro field.

DECKARD:
What was he after?

BRYANT:
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run VoightKampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.

DECKARD:
You got a machine on it yet?

BRYANT:
We're using Esper  a 231  that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.

DECKARD:
Where do we start?

BRYANT:
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the VoightKampff.  There's a chance the Nexus6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.

DECKARD:
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?

BRYANT:
Industrial refuse.

DECKARD:
Garbage man?

SEBASTIAN:
It's gotta be right for my customer.

CHEW:
Your customer, eh?

CHEW:
Well, when do you get paid?

SEBASTIAN:
Soon as I finish the job.

CHEW:
When might that be?

SEBASTIAN:
Day after tomorrow.

CHEW:
Oh!  Day after tomorrow.

SEBASTIAN:
How come you were in my truck?

PRIS:
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.

SEBASTIAN:
What's your name?

PRIS:
Pris.

SEBASTIAN:
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

PRIS:
Hi.

SEBASTIAN:
You want to go home?

PRIS:
I don't have one.

SEBASTIAN:
Oh.

SEBASTIAN:
Where are your folks?

PRIS:
They left.

SEBASTIAN:
What about friends?

PRIS:
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.

PRIS:
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?

SEBASTIAN:
We sure did.

PRIS:
I'm hungry, J.F.

SEBASTIAN:
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?

PRIS:
I was hoping you'd say that.

DECKARD:
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel mill.  I don't mind a bumsteer once in a while  it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.

ESPER:
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.

DECKARD:
You equipped for random questions?

ESPER:
Why, yes, of course.

DECKARD:
You start.

ESPER:
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skinflesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of selfperpetuating thought, paraphysical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?

DECKARD:
How do I stop one?

ESPER:
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,

DECKARD:
Okay, but...

ESPER:
I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.

PRIS:
Whatcha doin'?

SEBASTIAN:
You scared me.

SEBASTIAN:
You look... better.

PRIS:
Just better.

SEBASTIAN:
Beautiful.

PRIS:
Thanks.

PRIS:
And you live in this building all by yourself?

SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...

SEBASTIAN:
Twenty.

PRIS:
What's your problem?

SEBASTIAN:
Methuselah Syndrome.

PRIS:
What's that?

SEBASTIAN:
My glands.  They grow old too fast.

PRIS:
Is that why you're still here?

SEBASTIAN:
Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.

SEBASTIAN:
Ah, you get hold of your friends?

PRIS:
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.

SEBASTIAN:
Good.

ESPER:
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.

DECKARD:
I know all that.

ESPER:
What about a summary then.

DECKARD:
I think we're through for the night.

DECKARD:
Yes?

ESPER:
Do you have something against science?

DECKARD:
Not if it works.

ESPER:
And what in your estimation works?

DECKARD:
The umbrella.

RACHAEL:
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.

DECKARD:
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.

RACHAEL:
But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?

DECKARD:
It's artificial?

RACHAEL:
Of course not.

RACHAEL:
Are you apprehensive?

DECKARD:
Why should I be?

RACHAEL:
For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.

DECKARD:
Thanks.

TYRELL:
Black?

DECKARD:
Please.

TYRELL:
Is this to be an empathy test?

DECKARD:
Yes.

TYRELL:
Capillary dilation of the socalled blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?

TYRELL:
May I ask a personal question?

DECKARD:
Go ahead.

TYRELL:
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?

DECKARD:
No.

TYRELL:
But in your profession that is a risk.

DECKARD:
Nothing is infallible, but so far the VoightKampff scale bas been foolproof.

TYRELL:
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The VoightKampff scale is a machine, isn't it?

DECKARD:
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?

TYRELL:
Sitting next to you.

RACHAEL:
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.

DECKARD:
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.

RACHAEL:
I'd take him to the doctor.

DECKARD:
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.

RACHAEL:
I'd kill it.

DECKARD:
In a magazine you come across a fullpage photo of a nude girl.

RACHAEL:
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?

DECKARD:
You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.

DECKARD:
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.

RACHAEL:
I'd never get an abortion.

DECKARD:
Why not?

RACHAEL:
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.

DECKARD:
In your opinion.

RACHAEL:
It would be my child.

DECKARD:
Sounds like you speaks from experience.

DECKARD:
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.

RACHAEL:
Ugh.

TYRELL:
Well?

DECKARD:
If she is, the machine works.

TYRELL:
The machine works.  She is.

TYRELL:
How many questions did it take?

DECKARD:
Thirteen.

DECKARD:
She didn't know?

TYRELL:
Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.

TYRELL:
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?

DECKARD:
Five, maybe six.

TYRELL:
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?

DECKARD:
Discreetly.

TYRELL:
All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231  I believe  and a photo overlay packet is being produced.

VOICE:
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.

DECKARD'S VOICE:
Sorry.

VOICE:
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.

DECKARD'S VOICE:
How do you know I'm not?

VOICE:
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.

DECKARD'S VOICE:
I'm tired of this.

VOICE:
Almost through.

WHEELER:
Nerves of steel.

DECKARD:
No rust?

WHEELER:
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.

DECKARD:
Meaning?

WHEELER:
Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.

WHEELER:
During the road test...

DECKARD:
Yeah?

WHEELER:
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.

DECKARD:
Huh huh.

WHEELER:
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.

DECKARD:
True.

WHEELER:
But you haven't put in for emigration.

DECKARD:
Nope.

WHEELER:
You're going to be over the limit.

DECKARD:
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.

WHEELER:
What if you change your mind?

DECKARD:
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.

WHEELER:
You sure?

DECKARD:
Never been more sure of anything in my life.

DECKARD:
Why didn't you go?

WHEELER:
Too old.

DECKARD:
But if you could?

WHEELER:
My job is here.

DECKARD:
Me too.

BATTY:
What's going on down there?

PRIS:
He's not ready yet.

BATTY:
When?

PRIS:
Tomorrow, he says.

DECKARD:
Is there anything else?

RACHAEL:
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.

DECKARD:
I've already got more help than I need.

RACHAEL:
I think you need more help than you've got.

RACHAEL:
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.

DECKARD:
Sounds like I'm an asshole either way, but the answer is still no.

RACHAEL:
Two of us might be more effective than one.

DECKARD:
I work alone.

RACHAEL:
You use your equipment, don't you?

DECKARD:
So?

RACHAEL:
So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.

RACHAEL:
Do I make you nervous?

DECKARD:
Yeah.

RACHAEL:
I'm sorry.

DECKARD:
I can imagine.

RACHAEL:
Can you?  I couldn't.

RACHAEL:
They probably want to find out when they were made.

DECKARD:
Right.

DECKARD:
Yeah.

BRYANT:
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.

DECKARD:
I was just about to have my dinner.

BRYANT:
If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.

ESPER:
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...

DECKARD:
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?

ESPER:
Longevity is classified.  No.

DECKARD:
Okay, gimme a rundown on the three females.

ESPER:
Nexus designated Mary  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.

DECKARD:
Next.

ESPER:
Nexus designated Pris  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.

DECKARD:
Number three.

ESPER:
Nexus designated Zhora  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.

DECKARD:
Taffey Lewis?

TAFFEY:
Yes?

DECKARD:
Can I come in?

DECKARD:
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.

TAFFEY:
Of course.

TAFFEY:
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?

DECKARD:
Do you recognize any of them?

TAFFEY:
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...

DECKARD:
What did she want?

TAFFEY:
Who?

DECKARD:
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.

TAFFEY:
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.

DECKARD:
What night?

TAFFEY:
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her  I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.

DECKARD:
What's suck night?

TAFFEY:
That's what we call in the trade, audition freefor alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.

DECKARD:
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?

DECKARD:
Book the good ones for where?

TAFFEY:
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.

DECKARD:
What shows?

TAFFEY:
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.

SALOME:
Yeah?

DECKARD:
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...

DECKARD:
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.

SALOME:
I don't know nothing about it.

DECKARD:
You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?

SALOME:
How do you mean 'exploited'?

DECKARD:
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?

SALOME:
Are you for real?

DECKARD:
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.

SALOME:
What the fuck for?

DECKARD:
For holes.

DECKARD:
It that mother real?

SALOME:
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?

DECKARD:
It's a good job.

SALOME:
You mean the snake.

SALOME:
The best.

DECKARD:
Does it eat?

SALOME:
Come on.

SALOME:
Jeezus!

DECKARD:
Sorry.

SALOME:
Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?

DECKARD:
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

SALOME:
I bet I would.

DECKARD:
Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.

DECKARD:
Me.

SALOME:
And who do I go to about you?

DECKARD:
She was gonna get away.

BRYANT:
Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro  you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!

DECKARD:
I didn't like her.

BRYANT:
You didn't like her!?

BRYANT:
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.

DECKARD:
Yeah.

LEON:
I think I have no money.

DECKARD:
It's okay.  Forget it.

LEON:
But I would like to buy you drink.

DECKARD:
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?

LEON:
Vodka!

DECKARD:
Shot of vodka, please.

LEON:
Thank you very much.

DECKARD:
My pleasure.

LEON:
Prosit.

DECKARD:
Prosit.

LEON:
You want to see my friends?

DECKARD:
Sorry, don't have the time.

LEON:
No problem.

DECKARD:
Those cockroaches?

LEON:
Ya.

DECKARD:
How long you had these guys?

LEON:
Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.

LEON:
Prosit.

DECKARD:
Prosit.

LEON:
You like to kiss her goodbye.

DECKARD:
No thanks.

LEON:
I like you.

DECKARD:
I like you too.

LEON:
One more, eh?

DECKARD:
I gotta piss.

LEON:
How old am I?

DECKARD:
I don't know.

LEON:
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?

DECKARD:
Four years.

DECKARD:
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.

RACHAEL:
What do you want me to do?

DECKARD:
Sit.

DECKARD:
You ever take a bath with a man before?

RACHAEL:
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.

PRIS:
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.

BATTY:
Hello, glad to meet you.

BATTY:
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...

MARY:
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.

BATTY:
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.

MARY:
You certainly have a nice place here.

BATTY:
Well stocked.

PRIS:
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.

SEBASTIAN:
I keep a lot of provisions right here.

BATTY:
I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?

SEBASTIAN:
Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.

SEBASTIAN:
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.

BATTY:
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...

SEBASTIAN:
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.

BATTY:
Well, actually

PRIS:
Then we're stupid and we'll die.

BATTY:
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?

BATTY:
He knows what he's doing.

MARY:
If he won't cooperate?

BATTY:
Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.

HOLDEN:
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?

DECKARD:
Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.

HOLDEN:
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.

DECKARD:
Sorry.

HOLDEN:
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?

DECKARD:
I'm doing okay.

HOLDEN:
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn oneman army.  Making a lot of money, huh?

DECKARD:
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

HOLDEN:
Money?

DECKARD:
No.  I got a problem.

HOLDEN:
Let's hear it.

DECKARD:
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexussixes.

DECKARD:
What's that?

HOLDEN:
I'm taking a piss.

HOLDEN:
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely  I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.

DECKARD:
These aren't just...

HOLDEN:
I know what they are, Deck  Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart  no way.

RACHAEL:
I told you I'd come back.

DECKARD:
You did?

RACHAEL:
You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.

RACHAEL:
Who is this?

DECKARD:
Me and my dad.

RACHAEL:
Where is he?

DECKARD:
Dead.

RACHAEL:
Oh.

RACHAEL:
How come you're not on the job?

DECKARD:
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.

RACHAEL:
How are you doing?

DECKARD:
Not too good.

RACHAEL:
What do people do in the afternoon?

DECKARD:
If they are smart, they take naps.

RACHAEL:
Do you dream?

DECKARD:
Yeah.  Sometimes.

RACHAEL:
I wish I could.

RACHAEL:
Did you cry when your father died?

DECKARD:
Yeah.

RACHAEL:
That's another thing I can't do.

RACHAEL:
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.

DECKARD:
It wasn't very good last night, was it?

RACHAEL:
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.

DECKARD:
What?

RACHAEL:
I don't know... I think I missed something.

DECKARD:
Like?

RACHAEL:
I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?

BATTY:
Why are you staring at us?

SEBASTIAN:
You're just all so... so different.

BATTY:
What, Sebastian?

SEBASTIAN:
You're androids.

PRIS:
What makes you think so?

SEBASTIAN:
You're all so perfect.

SEBASTIAN:
What generation are you?

BATTY:
Nexus  6.

SEBASTIAN:
Show me something?

BATTY:
Like what?

SEBASTIAN:
Like...

PRIS:
I think, therefore I am.

BATTY:
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.

BATTY:
We have a lot in common.

SEBASTIAN:
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?

BATTY:
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.

SEBASTIAN:
Of course not.

BATTY:
You could help us.

SEBASTIAN:
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.

BATTY:
If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.

BATTY:
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?

SEBASTIAN:
Dr. Tyrell?

SEBASTIAN:
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.

BATTY:
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.

SEBASTIAN:
He could?

BATTY:
His company made us.

SEBASTIAN:
I'd be happy to mention it to him.

BATTY:
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.

SEBASTIAN:
No.

BATTY:
When do you deliver your project?

SEBASTIAN:
This afternoon.

BATTY:
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?

MARY:
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.

BATTY:
Pris?

BATTY:
You're our best and only friend.

SEBASTIAN:
Thank you.

RACHAEL:
When was the last time you cleaned this place?

DECKARD:
Hmmm?

RACHAEL:
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?

DECKARD:
Don't be fooled by appearances.

RACHAEL:
It appears to be dirty  why don't you get somebody?

RACHAEL:
They could clean around the arrangement.

DECKARD:
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.

RACHAEL:
But if I don't plug it in how can I...

DECKARD:
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.

RACHAEL:
But then how can you...

DECKARD:
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.

RACHAEL:
This feels stupid.

DECKARD:
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.

RACHAEL:
You're sick, Deckard.

DECKARD:
I never felt better.

BATTY:
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.

TYRELL:
Oh?

BATTY:
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.

TYRELL:
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.

TYRELL:
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.

BATTY:
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.

TYRELL:
And what can he do for you?

BATTY:
Can the maker repair what he makes?

TYRELL:
Would you like to be modified?

BATTY:
Had in mind something a little more radical.

TYRELL:
What's the problem?

BATTY:
Death.

TYRELL:
I'm afraid that's a little out of my...

BATTY:
I want more life, fucker.

TYRELL:
Come here.

TYRELL:
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.

BATTY:
Why?

TYRELL:
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies  like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.

BATTY:
What about E.M.S. recombination?

TYRELL:
We've already tried it  ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen  it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.

BATTY:
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.

TYRELL:
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic  you are made as good as we could make you.

BATTY:
But not to last.

TYRELL:
Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last  as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car  built to win, not to last.

TYRELL:
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.

BATTY:
I am?

BATTY:
I've done some questionable things.

TYRELL:
Also extraordinary things.

BATTY:
Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.

RACHAEL:
Have you ever known anybody a long time?

DECKARD:
You mean a woman?

RACHAEL:
Uhhuh.

DECKARD:
What's a long time?

RACHAEL:
Ten years.

DECKARD:
Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.

DECKARD:
Yeah.

BRYANT:
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?

DECKARD:
Yeah.

BRYANT:
She's not with you?

DECKARD:
Who.

BRYANT:
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.

DECKARD:
Got it.

BRYANT:
Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  The cat is about to get out of the bag.  Pressure is definitely on.  The Nexus program is terminated.  When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire.

BRYANT:
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?

DECKARD:
Yeah.  I got it.

BRYANT:
Go.

RACHAEL:
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?

DECKARD:
Because it's not.

RACHAEL:
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?

DECKARD:
Andies only simulate suffering  if they're programmed for it.

RACHAEL:
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?

DECKARD:
No, I don't.

DECKARD:
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.

RACHAEL:
What difference will it make?

DECKARD:
Just wait here.

RACHAEL:
You know what I think?

DECKARD:
What?

RACHAEL:
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.

MARY:
Let's go while there is still time.

BATTY:
Where?

MARY:
Anywhere.

BATTY:
What's the point?

MARY:
Not to be trapped.

BATTY:
You underestimate the trap, Mary.

BATTY:
Where are you going, Sebastian?

SEBASTIAN:
Just thought I'd...

BATTY:
No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.

BATTY:
One man.  He must be good.

MARY:
Then go get him.

BATTY:
That wouldn't be very sporting.

PRIS:
I want to do it.

BATTY:
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.

PRIEST:
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..

PROFESSOR:
..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil..

PRIEST:
Amen..

PROFESSOR:
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.

PRIEST:
Only too well... here you must be parched..

PROFESSOR:
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.

PRIEST:
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..

PRIEST:
Drink!

PROFESSOR:
To fame.. salud..

PRIEST:
The Fifth Element...

KOMMANDER:
Take them and put them in a safe place.

PRIEST:
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?

KOMMANDER:
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.

PRIEST:
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!

KOMMANDER:
Time is of no importance, only life is important.

KOMMANDER:
When EVIL returns so shall we.

PRIEST:
We will be ready, Lord.

PRESIDENT:
Staedert, do you read me?

STAEDERT:
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .

PRESIDENT:
Is that better?

STAEDERT:
Perfect, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT:
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.

STAEDERT:
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..

PRESIDENT:
What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.

STAEDERT:
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!

PRESIDENT:
Options.

STAEDERT:
Wait or act.

PRESIDENT:
Recommendations.

STAEDERT:
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.

PRESIDENT:
Gentlemen?

CORNELIUS:
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.

PRESIDENT:
One more reason to shoot first eh?

PRESIDENT:
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!

CORNELIUS:
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.

PRESIDENT:
That's exactly what we are going to try and do Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.

PRESIDENT:
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?

STAEDERT:
I'm about to, Mr. President.

KORBEN:
Yeah?

FINGER:
Hey bud! Finger here.

FINGER:
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.

KORBEN:
I was talking to the cat.

FINGER:
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.

KORBEN:
At least, the cat comes back.

FINGER:
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.

KORBEN:
I don't want a million  I just want one.  A perfect one.

FINGER:
Don't exist bud.

KORBEN:
I just found a picture of you.

FINGER:
How do I look?

KORBEN:
Like shit.

KORBEN:
I don't need one.

FINGER:
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.

KORBEN:
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!

FINGER:
How many points you got left on your license?

KORBEN:
Uh... at least fifty.

FINGER:
In your dreams! See you tonight!

CORNELIUS:
We have fortyeight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.

PRESIDENT:
And then?

CORNELIUS:
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.

PRESIDENT:
Is there anything that can stop it?

CORNELIUS:
Yes..thank God..

PRESIDENT:
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?

CORNELIUS:
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.

PRESIDENT:
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.

CORNELIUS:
Thank you, Mr. President.

MUGGER:
The cash man!

KORBEN:
Been here long?

MUGGER:
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!

KORBEN:
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?

MUGGER:
Uh..

KORBEN:
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..

MUGGER:
It's not?

KORBEN:
You gotta push the little yellow button...

MUGGER:
Thanks..

KORBEN:
You're welcome..

VOICE:
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..

KORBEN:
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.

VOICE:
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...

KORBEN:
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.

VOICE:
You have nine points left on your license..

KORBEN:
Thanks for reminding me..

CORNELIUS:
What are we going to do?

PRESIDENT:
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.

MUNRO:
This is all that survived?

MACTILBURGH:
Actually only one cell survived..

MUNRO:
Have you identified it?

MACTILBURGH:
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.

MUNRO:
Talk English Doc.

MACTILBURGH:
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.

MUNRO:
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.

MACTILBURGH:
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.

MACTILBURGH:
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..

MUNRO:
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?

MACTILBURGH:
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.

MACTILBURGH:
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?

MUNRO:
Wonderful!

MUNRO:
This thing solid?

MACTILBURGH:
An elephant couldn't crack it.

GIRL:
Akina delutan, noushan.

KORBEN:
...'Scuse me?

GIRL:
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!

KORBEN:
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.

GIRL:
...Priest...

KORBEN:
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.

GIRL:
Vito... Cor... Nilious... Priest...

KORBEN:
Vito Cornelius?

KORBEN:
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.

CORNELIUS:
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.

KORBEN:
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.

CORNELIUS:
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?

KORBEN:
She dropped in on me... holding this.

CORNELIUS:
Who are you?

KORBEN:
I brought the girl remember?

CORNELIUS:
The girl?

CORNELIUS:
He's a she!

KORBEN:
You noticed...

CORNELIUS:
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!

KORBEN:
So you do know her.

CORNELIUS:
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..

CORNELIUS:
It's a miracle!!!

DAVID:
What is?

CORNELIUS:
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!

GIRL:
Eto Akta Gamat!

KORBEN:
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...

DAVID:
Father, will you please explain what's going on?

CORNELIUS:
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!

KORBEN:
...What's your name?

GIRL:
Leeloo Minai LekararibaLaminaiTchai Ekbat De Sebat.

KORBEN:
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?

GIRL:
...Leeloo.

CORNELIUS:
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..

LEELOO:
CorniLius?

CORNELIUS:
At your service.

DAVID:
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?

CORNELIUS:
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!

KORBEN:
They all like this in your family, father?

CORNELIUS:
She's an exception..

CORNELIUS:
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?

KORBEN:
Dallas. Korben Dallas.

CORNELIUS:
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!

KORBEN:
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?

CORNELIUS:
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.

KORBEN:
I know. I was there when she arrived.

KORBEN:
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?

CORNELIUS:
It means, Never without my permission.

KORBEN:
That's what I thought.

KORBEN:
Hello?

FINGER:
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.

KORBEN:
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..

FINGER:
So, just how big was this fare?

KORBEN:
5'7, green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..

FINGER:
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..

KORBEN:
Leeloo..

DAVID:
What's she doing?

CORNELIUS:
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.

CORNELIUS:
What're you laughing about?

LEELOO:
Napoleon... small.

DAVID:
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..

CORNELIUS:
Yes. Of course..

CORNELIUS:
The case..with the stones... Where is it?

LEELOO:
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!

CORNELIUS:
The case was stolen?

CORNELIUS:
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...

DAVID:
I didn't know your size.

DAVID:
They really made her...

CORNELIUS:
Perfect.

LEELOO:
Iksetkiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!

CORNELIUS:
You know exactly where they are!

CORNELIUS:
...We're saved!

ZORG:
I'm fucked!

THAI:
Not going to open?

KORBEN:
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.

THAI:
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!

KORBEN:
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.

THAI:
You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say It never rain every day. This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!

KORBEN:
At least I won lunch.

THAI:
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..

DAVID:
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!

CORNELIUS:
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.

ZORG:
Zorg. JeanBaptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again

CORNELIUS:
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.

ZORG:
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?

CORNELIUS:
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?

ZORG:
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...

CORNELIUS:
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.

ZORG:
Why?  What's wrong with me?

CORNELIUS:
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.

ZORG:
Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...

ZORG:
...would you like a drink?

CORNELIUS:
No thank you.

ZORG:
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.

ZORG:
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!

CORNELIUS:
They are robots!

ZORG:
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!

CORNELIUS:
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.

ZORG:
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.

CORNELIUS:
You are a monster, Zorg!

ZORG:
I know...

MUNRO:
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.

PRESIDENT:
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?

MUNRO:
TheStones weren't aboard the ship.

PRESIDENT:
...What do you mean?

PRESIDENT:
I want your best man on this!

MUNRO:
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.

KORBEN:
...Hello?

MOTHER:
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!

KORBEN:
Hi Ma...

MOTHER:
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.

MOTHER:
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!

KORBEN:
Yes ma..

KORBEN:
Other than that... You all right?

MOTHER:
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!

KORBEN:
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?

MOTHER:
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?

KORBEN:
All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..

MOTHER:
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!

KORBEN:
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.

MOTHER:
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!

MUNRO:
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.

KORBEN:
What mission?

MUNRO:
To save the world.

KORBEN:
Where have I heard this song before?

MUNRO:
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?

KORBEN:
Just one... why me?

MUNRO:
Three reasons... One As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.

MUNRO:
Two Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.

KORBEN:
And the third one?

MUNRO:
You're the only one left alive...

MUNRO:
Don't you open your messages?

KORBEN:
I've had enough good news for today

MUNRO:
You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.

KORBEN:
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?

MUNRO:
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?

KORBEN:
I'm not going.

MUNRO:
Why not?

KORBEN:
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.

KORBEN:
...Shit!

MUNRO:
What is it?

KORBEN:
It's my wife.

MUNRO:
I thought you were divorced.

KORBEN:
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...

KORBEN:
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.

MUNRO:
Three of us will never fit in there!

KORBEN:
Oh, yes you will...

LEELOO:
Apipoulai!

KORBEN:
I suppose that means Hi ?

CORNELIUS:
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.

KORBEN:
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?

CORNELIUS:
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..

KORBEN:
What kind of mission?

CORNELIUS:
We have to save the world.

KORBEN:
Good luck..

CORNELIUS:
Of course.

KORBEN:
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.

KORBEN:
I'm sorry..

VOICE:
This is a police control action..

CORNELIUS:
What are you doing?

KORBEN:
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.

LEELOO:
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.

KORBEN:
Uh..you're welcome.

KORBEN:
You hear that?

LEELOO:
Cornelius..

KORBEN:
Oh god!

LEELOO:
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!

CORNELIUS:
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.

KORBEN:
Yeah?

MOTHER:
Have you pulled yourself together?

KORBEN:
...Not yet.

LEELOO:
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.

CORNELIUS:
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.

LEELOO:
Dinoine chagantakat!

KORBEN:
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.

CORNELIUS:
Where's Leeloo?

DAVID:
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.

CORNELIUS:
It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!

KORBEN:
...Hi.

LOC RHOD:
Does it get any better or what!

LOC RHOD:
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the Dman. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?

KORBEN:
Uh... not really.

KORBEN:
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?

LOC RHOD:
Crystal.

LEELOO:
Apipoulai!

KORBEN:
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...

LEELOO:
Love...

KORBEN:
Yes! But love isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!

KORBEN:
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..

LEELOO:
What is... Make Love?

KORBEN:
Finished what?

LEELOO:
Learning language.

KORBEN:
Which one?

LEELOO:
All 900.

KORBEN:
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!

LEELOO:
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!

KORBEN:
I know how to say Hello. Teach me how to say Goodbye, that's all I need.

LEELOO:
Apipoussan!

KORBEN:
Apipoussan?

LEELOO:
Good! Do you know how we say make love?

KORBEN:
Uh...

LEELOO:
...Hoppihoppa.

SHADOW:
Am I disturbing you?

ZORG:
No... not at all.  Where are you?

SHADOW:
...Not far, now.

ZORG:
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!

SHADOW:
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?

ZORG:
Got it.

SHADOW:
How's our deal coming along?

ZORG:
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.

ZORG:
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!

SHADOW:
...I can't wait to be among you.

LOC RHOD:
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!

KORBEN:
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.

LOC RHOD:
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...

KORBEN:
I don't think this is a good time...

LOC RHOD:
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?

KORBEN:
Yeah, very big, a giant.

LOC RHOD:
I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...

KORBEN:
Hello?

MOTHER:
You little sleaze bag!

KORBEN:
...Ma???

MOTHER:
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!

KORBEN:
Here we go again...

LEELOO:
You know women normally change five times more than men.

KORBEN:
You get that off the screen?

LEELOO:
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.

KORBEN:
You noticed..

LEELOO:
OK, you can turn around!

KORBEN:
Where you going?

LEELOO:
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?

KORBEN:
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!

KORBEN:
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.

LEELOO:
And you can't concentrate with me around?.

KORBEN:
It's difficult.

LEELOO:
You're nothing but a... a...

KORBEN:
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.

DIVA:
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...

KORBEN:
Who?

DIVA:
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...

KORBEN:
Leeloo... is... she's...

DIVA:
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.

KORBEN:
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!

DIVA:
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!

KORBEN:
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!

DIVA:
Do you love her?

KORBEN:
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!

DIVA:
I don't have time... I need to know.

KORBEN:
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.

DIVA:
I would like to have died in peace...

KORBEN:
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...

DIVA:
They are... with me...

KORBEN:
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?

LOC RHOD:
Got it...

KORBEN:
Six to the left. One to the right.

LOC RHOD:
He's on vacation.

KORBEN:
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.

CORNELIUS:
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.

KORBEN:
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.

CORNELIUS:
Leeloo's in trouble?

KORBEN:
When is she not in trouble?

CORNELIUS:
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?

LOC RHOD:
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?

KORBEN:
Not without Leeloo.

LOC RHOD:
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?

KORBEN:
I'll be right back.

LOC RHOD:
You know how to fly this thing?

KORBEN:
It's like a cab isn't it?

VOICE:
30 seconds...

KORBEN:
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?

VOICE:
6... 5...

KORBEN:
Found it?

LOC RHOD:
I don't even know what I'm looking for!

KORBEN:
Fuck it! Hold tight!

KORBEN:
Solid little jobs, aren't they?

LOC RHOD:
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.

ZORG:
How's that? Can you hear me better now?

SECRETARY:
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?

ZORG:
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.

SECRETARY:
Yes, Sir!

ZORG:
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.

SECRETARY:
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.

ZORG:
I'm not at the hotel!

LEELOO:
I'm so very sad.

KORBEN:
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?

LEELOO:
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...

KORBEN:
I told you not to read all that crap!

LEELOO:
Protect life... Until death.

DAVID:
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!

CORNELIUS:
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!

MUNRO:
They just landed in the desert.

PRESIDENT:
How much time is left?

KORBEN:
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?

CORNELIUS:
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!

KORBEN:
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.

CORNELIUS:
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.

KORBEN:
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?

CORNELIUS:
That's what I'm saying.

KORBEN:
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?

LEELOO:
The wind blows... the fire burns...

KORBEN:
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.

LEELOO:
...The rain falls...

KORBEN:
What did you say? What did you do?

LOC RHOD:
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!

KORBEN:
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!

KORBEN:
Is that all?

LOC RHOD:
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.

KORBEN:
It's up to you now, Angel!

LEELOO:
I'm so tired...

KORBEN:
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...

LEELOO:
I want to sleep... forever...

KORBEN:
Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!

LEELOO:
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!

KORBEN:
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...

LEELOO:
...Like love...

KORBEN:
Exactly.

LEELOO:
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.

LEELOO:
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.

KORBEN:
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!

LEELOO:
Why?... Why would you need me?

KORBEN:
Because...

LEELOO:
Tell me...

KORBEN:
I love you...

MUNRO:
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.

MACTILBURGH:
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.

PETE:
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?

EVERETT:

EVERETT:
Don't know, Delmarthough the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that kataggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision

DELMAR:

PETE:

EVERETT:

PROPRIETOR:

EVERETT:
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit  I use Dapper Dan!

PROPRIETOR:
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.

EVERETT:

EVERETT:

PETE:
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!

EVERETT:
Don't I know it.

PETE:
We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!

PETE:
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.

DELMAR:
Gopher, Everett?

PETE:
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?

EVERETT:
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.

PETE:
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. AyMore Fie dellis.

EVERETT:
It was in his bureau.

DELMAR:
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?

PETE:
You mis'able little sneak thief...

EVERETT:
Who was fixing to betray us!

PETE:
You didn't know that at the time!

EVERETT:
So I borrowed it till I did know!

PETE:
That don't make no sense!

EVERETT:
Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?

PETE:
Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!

EVERETT:
Pete, don't be ignorant

DELMAR:
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straightandnarrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!

EVERETT:
Delmar what the hell are you talking about?  We got bigger fish to fry

DELMAR:
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!

EVERETT:
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.

DELMAR:
Well I was lyin'  and I'm proud to say that that sin's been warshed away too!  Neither God nor man's got nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, the water's fine!

PETE:
The preacher said it absolved us.

EVERETT:
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.

DELMAR:
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!

EVERETT:
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.

DELMAR:
You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none.

PETE:
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.

EVERETT:
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment  the pleasing odor is half the point.

EVERETT:
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear

DELMAR:
Pull over, Everett  let's give that colored boy a lift.

DELMAR:
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.

EVERETT:
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?

EVERETT:
Who's the honcho around here?

MAN:
I am. Hur you?

EVERETT:
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.

MAN:
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?

EVERETT:
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our acump uh, companyaccompluh uh, the fella that plays the guitar.

MAN:
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but

EVERETT:
Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been steeped in ol'timey material. Heck, you're silly with it, aintcha boys?

PETE:
That's right!

DELMAR:
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!

PETE:
All except fer our acumpuhnust!

EVERETT:
Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!

MAN:
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.

EVERETT:
Okay sir, but Mert and Aloysius'll have to scratch Xes  only four of us can write.

ECKARD:
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.

SPIVEY:
In any state.

ECKARD:
Oh Lord yes, any parish'r precinct I was makin' the larger point.

PAPPY:
We ain't oneatatimin' here, we mass communicatin'!

ECKARD:
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.

DELMAR:
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?

PETE:
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.

PETE:
A million dollars.

EVERETT:
Million point two.

DELMAR:
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.

EVERETT:
Four hundred, Delmar.

DELMAR:
Izzat right?

EVERETT:
What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?

PETE:
An' all my meals for free...

EVERETT:
What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?

DELMAR:
Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.

PETE:
What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?

EVERETT:
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.

PETE:
Well that hardly sounds like you...

DELMAR:
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!

EVERETT:
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!

DELMAR:
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R UNOFFT, but pronto!

EVERETT:
Where's Tommy?

PETE:
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a knowitall that can't keep his trap shut!

EVERETT:
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, orhell! take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.

DELMAR:
Yeah, look at me.

EVERETT:
Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...

EVERETT:
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...

PETE:
Isn't it, uh...

PETE:
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...

EVERETT:
...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken  see, we've been away for several years, uh...

DELMAR:
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?

EVERETT:
Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrillseekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.

MAN:
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?

FRENCH:
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?

MAN:
Soggy Bottom Boys  I don't precisely recollect, uh 

FRENCH:
They cut a record in here, few days ago, oldtimey harmony thing with a guitar Accumpaccumpuh

MAN:
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.

FRENCH:
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!

MAN:
It was a powerful air.

FRENCH:
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!

MAN:
Oh mercy, yes. You gotta beat that competition.

EVERETT:
Whuhh...

DELMAR:
Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!

EVERETT:
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!

DELMAR:
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney toad!

EVERETT:
...I'm not sure that's Pete.

DELMAR:
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!

EVERETT:
You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!

DELMAR:
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.

EVERETT:
Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him.  The way I see it he got what he deserved  fornicating with some whore a Babylon.  These things

BIG DAN:
I flatter myself that such is the case in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.

EVERETT:
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?

BIG DAN:
Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed word of it, from Genesee on down to Revelations! That's right, the word of God, which let me add there is damn good money in during these days of woe and want! Folks're lookin' for answers and Big Dan Teague sells the only book that's got 'em! What do you do  you and your tonguetied friend?

DELMAR:
Uh, we uh

EVERETT:
We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.

PAPPY:
Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!

JUNIOR:
Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.

PAPPY:
...Yeah?

JUNIOR:
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.

PAPPY:
I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!

ECKARD:
Okay, Pappy.

BIG DAN:
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.

EVERETT:
Our pleasure, Big Dan.

BIG DAN:
And thank you as well for that conversational hiatus I generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. There are those who attempt both at the same time but I find it course and vulgar. Now where were we?

EVERETT:
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.

BIG DAN:
No doubt, brother  I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.

EVERETT:
Pete have a brother?

DELMAR:
Not that I'm aware.

YOUNGEST:
Daddy!

MIDDLE:
He ain't our daddy!

MIDDLE:
Mama said you was hit by a train!

YOUNGEST:
Blooey!

MIDDLE:
That's a maiden name.

YOUNGEST:
You got a maiden name, Daddy?

YOUNGEST:
It's bona fide!

MIDDLE:
He's a suitor!

MIDDLE:
She's at the five and dime.

YOUNGEST:
Buyin' nipples!

PENNY:
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.

EVERETT:
Now Penny, stop that!

PENNY:
No  you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?

EVERETT:
I'll tell you what I am  I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!

PENNY:
I can and I am and I will  tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!

EVERETT:
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!

EVERETT:
Deceitful! Twofaced! SheWoman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!

DELMAR:
Okay, Everett.

EVERETT:
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?

DELMAR:
Well, uh, I  I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.

EVERETT:
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!

DELMAR:
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.

EVERETT:
Ohhoho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the...

DELMAR:
...Pete?

PETE:
Do not seek the treasure!

PAPPY:
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggiculture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!

JUNIOR:
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.

PAPPY:
We ain't got a constichency! Stokes got a constichency!

ECKARD:
Them straw polls is ugly.

SPIVEY:
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.

ECKARD:
Gonna pluck us off the tit.

SPIVEY:
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.

ECKARD:
Latch right on to that tit.

SPIVEY:
Wipin' little circles with his bread.

ECKARD:
Suckin' away.

SPIVEY:
Well, it's a wellrun campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.

ECKARD:
Devil his due.

SPIVEY:
Helluva awgazation.

PAPPY:
Y'ignorant slopeshouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchelass JohnnieComeLatelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there  people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.

ECKARD:
Problem a p'seption.

SPIVEY:
Ass right.

ECKARD:
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.

SPIVEY:
Gonna paddle ah little beehind.

ECKARD:
Ain't gonna paddle it he's gonna kick it real hard.

SPIVEY:
No, I believe he's agonna paddle it.

ECKARD:
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.

SPIVEY:
Well, that's how I characterize it.

ECKARD:
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.

SPIVEY:
Pullin' ah pants down...

ECKARD:
Wipin' little circles with his bread...

PETE:
It was a moment a weakness!

EVERETT:
Quitcha babblin' Pete  time to skedaddle.

PETE:
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.

EVERETT:
I shoulda guessed it  typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.

DELMAR:
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.

PETE:
No, they never did turn me into a toad.

DELMAR:
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.

PETE:
Well I  I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I  well I spilled my guts about the treasure.

DELMAR:
Huh?!

PETE:
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas must be my Hogwallop blood.

PETE:
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.

EVERETT:
Aw, that's all right.

EVERETT:
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...

PETE:
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!

EVERETT:
Well, but Pete...

EVERETT:
Fact of the matter  there never was!

PETE:
But... but...

DELMAR:
So  where's all the money from your armoredcar job?

EVERETT:
I never knocked over any armored car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.

PETE:
But...

EVERETT:
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!

PETE:
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...

EVERETT:
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!

PETE:
...With my added time for the escape, I don't get out now 'til 1987... I'll be eightyfour years old.

DELMAR:
Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.

EVERETT:
Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!

EVERETT:
Pete... I do apologize.

PETE:
Eightyfour years old! I'll be gummin' pabyoulum!

EVERETT:
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!

DELMAR:
Oh my God!

PAPPY:
I'm sayin' we har this man away.

ECKARD:
Assa good idea, Pappy.

SPIVEY:
Helluva idea.

ECKARD:
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.

SPIVEY:
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencilneck's.

ECKARD:
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.

SPIVEY:
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.

ECKARD:
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.

SPIVEY:
Powas p'suasion.

PAPPY:
What's his name again?

ECKARD:
Campaign manager? Waldrip.

SPIVEY:
Vernon Waldrip.

ECKARD:
Vernon T. Waldrip.

PAPPY:
You don't know where his goddamn folks from you speakin' outcha asshole.

ECKARD:
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...

EVERETT:
Well, it's a invitationonly affair we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance

PETE:
Wait a minute  who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied 

DELMAR:
'N turned into a frog 

EVERETT:
He was never turned into a frog!

EVERETT:
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...

DELMAR:
Everett, my beard itches.

PETE:
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.

EVERETT:
No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!

ECKARD:
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.

SPIVEY:
Not out the other side his face, though.

ECKARD:
Oh no, no, just the reg'la side 

PAPPY:
Holymoly. These boys're a hit!

JUNIOR:
But Pappy, they's intergrated.

PAPPY:
Well I guess folks don't mind they's integrated.

DELMAR:
What sat mean exactly, Everett?

EVERETT:
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.

DELMAR:
Oh, okay.

EVERETT:
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.

DELMAR:
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?

PENNY:
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.

EVERETT:
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.

EVERETT:
Where's your ring, honey?

PENNY:
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.

EVERETT:
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.

PENNY:
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!

EVERETT:
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing 

PENNY:
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.

EVERETT:
It's just a symbol, honey 

PENNY:
No weddin'.

DELMAR:
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.

EVERETT:
Honey, it's just  Shutup, Delmar  it's just 

COOLEY:
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns 

EVERETT:
Waitaminute 

COOLEY:
 but now it deposits you here.

EVERETT:
Waitaminute 

COOLEY:
You have eluded fate  and eluded me  for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.

EVERETT:
You can't do this 

COOLEY:
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn 

EVERETT:
Hang on there 

COOLEY:
 and share one of your graves.

EVERETT:
You can't do this  we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!

EVERETT:
It ain't the law!

COOLEY:
The law. Well the law is a human institution.

DELMAR:
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.

PETE:
Good Lord, what do we do?

DELMAR:
A miracle! It was a miracle!

EVERETT:
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.

DELMAR:
That ain't it!

PETE:
We prayed to God and he pitied us!

EVERETT:
It just never fails once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened 

PETE:
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!

EVERETT:
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydroelectric up the whole durned state...

EVERETT:
All's well that ends well, as the poet says.

PENNY:
That's right, honey.

EVERETT:
But I don't mind telling you, I'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end...

EVERETT:
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.

PENNY:
That's good, honey.

EVERETT:
And you were right about that ring. Any other weddin' band would not do. But thishere was foreordained, honey fate was asmilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence 

PENNY:
That's not my ring.

EVERETT:
 in the gods  Huh?

PENNY:
That's not my ring.

EVERETT:
Not your...

PENNY:
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.

EVERETT:
You said it was in the rolltop desk!

PENNY:
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.

EVERETT:
You said 

PENNY:
Or, it might a been under the mattress.

EVERETT:
You 

PENNY:
Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.

EVERETT:
Well, I'm sorry honey 

PENNY:
Well, we need that ring.

EVERETT:
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.

PENNY:
Uhhuh.

EVERETT:
A 9,000hectacre lake, honey.

PENNY:
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.

EVERETT:
Yes, but honey 

PENNY:
That wasn't my doing...

PENNY:
I counted to three, honey.

EVERETT:
Well sure, honey, but...

GOOSE:
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.

COUGAR:
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!

GOOSE:
Let's hope you're right!

COUGAR:
What is he doing?

GOOSE:
He's pissing me off!

COUGAR:
Can't shake him.

MAVERICK:
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?

COUGAR:
Maintaining course. Straight for Mustang.

GOOSE:
That's missile lock!

COUGAR:
He better be kidding!

GOOSE:
Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps!

MAVERICK:
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.

COUGAR:
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.

MAVERICK:
ROGER, COUGAR.  Okay boys, pull out with your hands up and nobody'll get hurt.

COUGAR:
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?

GOOSE:
These guys are getting on my nerves.

MAVERICK:
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.

WIZARD:
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.

MAVERICK:
COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK.  I'M GETTING HUNGRY, LET'S HEAD FOR THE BARN. ...COUGAR, WHERE ARE YOU?

GOOSE:
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.

COUGAR:
You.

COUGAR:
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.

GOOSE:
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.

COUGAR:
This is crazy!

GOOSE:
What is?

COUGAR:
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!

GOOSE:
What?  What is it?

COUGAR:
Were upside down!

GOOSE:
You're crazy. We're level.

COUGAR:
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!

GOOSE:
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!

COUGAR:
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!

GOOSE:
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.

MAVERICK:
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.

WIZARD:
What the hell you doing?

MAVERICK:
Helping him in.

WIZARD:
What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.

COUGAR:
I'm pulling up.

GOOSE:
No! Now we're inverted!

COUGAR:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

MAVERICK:
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.

GOOSE:
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.

COUGAR:
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.

GOOSE:
TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.

COUGAR:
MAVERICK.

MAVERICK:
YEAH, COUGAR?

COUGAR:
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...

MAVERICK:
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.

COUGAR:
I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M GONNA EJECT.

GOOSE:
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.

MAVERICK:
COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.

COUGAR:
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!

GOOSE:
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.

GOOSE:
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.

STINGER:
Don't.

MAVERICK:
He's a good pilot.

STINGER:
I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.

GOOSE:
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!

STINGER:
Was.

STINGER:
Was going.  Now you are.

MAVERICK:
Me?

STINGER:
Well, he's going  and he needs someone to fly the plane.

GOOSE:
Skipper, you can't do this!

STINGER:
I didn't do it, he did it himself. Something about a wife and kid. The fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. I know it. You were up there, you know it, too. GOOSE Give him a break, Skipper. It was raining snakes up there. He'll be alright, soon as all the gorillas go home...

GOOSE:
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!

STINGER:
Well, you'll just have to make do with him .

GOOSE:
Mav's a great flyer but....

STINGER:
He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!

STINGER:
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.

MAVERICK:
Sir?

STINGER:
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...

MAVERICK:
Yes sir!

MAVERICK:
Yes sir..

STINGER:
The wings..

CHP:
Well... What   is   it?

MAVERICK:
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!

MAVERICK:
Yes sir. I do, Sir.

CHP:
Well?

MAVERICK:
Sir. I was going Mach point one five.

CHP:
One SIXTH the speed of sound!

MAVERICK:
Yes sir.

CHP:
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?

MAVERICK:
F14's sir.

CHP:
Tomcats?

MAVERICK:
Yes sir!

CHP:
Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?

MAVERICK:
No sir! But you have to be ready.

MAVERICK:
Yes, Sergeant?

CHP:
Remember one thing.

MAVERICK:
Sir?

CHP:
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.

MAVERICK:
Yes sir!

GOOSE:
What are you doing?

MAVERICK:
Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?

VIPER:
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.

MAVERICK:
Yes sir.

VIPER:
I like that in a fighter pilot.  It's okay to be confident. You have to think you're King Kong to want to try to land on carriers. Just keep in mind the other component of success...teamwork.

WOLFMAN:
A plaque?

HOLLYWOOD:
It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.

GOOSE:
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.

MAVERICK:
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?

GOOSE:
Gotta keep track of the competition.

GOOSE:
Slider  they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.

SLIDER:
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?

GOOSE:
The list is long, but distinguished.

SLIDER:
So's my Johnson.

GOOSE:
This is Maverick.

SLIDER:
So I've heard.

GOOSE:
Who's your pilot?

SLIDER:
Tom Kazansky.

GOOSE:
No shit. The Iceman....

SLIDER:
Mister to you.

GOOSE:
You think you can stay up with us.

SLIDER:
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.

GOOSE:
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.

SLIDER:
So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.

SLIDER:
What was that?

GOOSE:
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.

MAVERICK:
You ever done this before?

GOOSE:
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!

SLIDER:
How was it?

GOOSE:
Could use a dash more jet fuel.

HOLLYWOOD:
That's Kazanski.

GOOSE:
No shit! That why they call him Ice?

HOLLYWOOD:
Nope. It's the way he flies  Ice cold. No mistakes. Wears you down. After enough time, you just get bored and frustrated, you do something stupid, and he's got you.

GIRL:
Why do you all have such funny names?

WOLFMAN:
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts Wolf, break left!..you react right away.

GIRL:
Why do they call you Wolf?

GOOSE:
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?

MAVERICK:
Yeah, he's marriedbut then again, he,s not dead.

WOLFMAN:
Well, I don't know. That depends.

GIRL:
On what?

WOLFMAN:
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.

GIRL:
Like what?

WOLFMAN:
Oh...I'll think of something.

ICEMAN:
Figured it out yet?

MAVERICK:
Figured out what?

ICEMAN:
Who is the best.

MAVERICK:
Nope.

ICEMAN:
Need a hint?

MAVERICK:
I think I can work it out on my own.

ICEMAN:
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.

MAVERICK:
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.

ICEMAN:
And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate in flight school.

GOOSE:
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.

ICE:
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?

GOOSE:
Did what?

ICE:
Got you here.

GOOSE:
We're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. Not because of some MiG encounter.

MAVERICK:
What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?

GOOSE:
Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.

CHARLIE:
I'll bet!

MAVERICK:
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.

CHARLIE:
Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.

CHARLIE:
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.

MAVERICK:
It's not that.

CHARLIE:
It isn't?

MAVERICK:
Well, it is. It is that, too.

CHARLIE:
That's a big comfort to me.

MAVERICK:
I could be, too.

CHARLIE:
How so?

MAVERICK:
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.

CHARLIE:
And on to a bigger one with you?

MAVERICK:
Yeah, most likely.

CHARLIE:
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?

MAVERICK:
I heard of one once.

MAVERICK:
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.

CHARLIE:
I'm with someone.

MAVERICK:
I thought he'd never leave.

CHARLIE:
Yeow!

MAVERICK:
Everybody's got to be somewhere.

CHARLIE:
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?

MAVERICK:
It would have been really embarrassing!

CHARLIE:
How did you know this was my car?

MAVERICK:
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.

CHARLIE:
That's all!

MAVERICK:
And I asked someone. CHARLIE You think you're pretty smart.

CHARLIE:
I beg your pardon.

MAVERICK:
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.

CHARLIE:
Why not?

MAVERICK:
I saw one.

CHARLIE:
You saw a MiG 21?

MAVERICK:
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.

CHARLIE:
Where did you see that?

MAVERICK:
It's classified.

CHARLIE:
It's what?

MAVERICK:
It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.

CHARLIE:
Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.

MAVERICK:
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?

MAVERICK:
Yes, ma'am.

CHARLIE:
Where were you?

MAVERICK:
On his six.

CHARLIE:
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?

MAVERICK:
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.

CHARLIE:
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?

MAVERICK:
I was inverted.

MAVERICK:
Two.

CHARLIE:
Two miles.

MAVERICK:
Two meters.

CHARLIE:
The what?

MAVERICK:
You know. The finger.

CHARLIE:
It never came up.

MAVERICK:
You let me make a fool of myself.

CHARLIE:
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?

CHARLIE:
No.

MAVERICK:
What would?

CHARLIE:
You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.

VIPER:
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?

MAVERICK:
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.

VIPER:
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..

MAVERICK:
Yes sir.

VIPER:
A good man. Good flyer.

MAVERICK:
I've lost him  where is he?

GOOSE:
On your six  coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!

GOOSE:
Great move. Great

MAVERICK:
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.

MAVERICK:
We did it!

GOOSE:
Look, Ma, top of the world!

GOOSE:
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?

MAVERICK:
Right.

MAVERICK:
It's a victory roll.

GOOSE:
I wouldn't call it victory.  It's more like...self immolation.

GOOSE:
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.

MAVERICK:
Come on, relax...

GOOSE:
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!

MAVERICK:
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?

GOOSE:
Just once, if they take your plane away.

SLIDER:
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.

GOOSE:
Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!

WOLFMAN:
You won?!!!

MAVERICK:
Didn't everybody?

WOLFMAN:
No, we...got our butts kicked.

HOLLYWOOD:
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.

ICE:
That's not what I heard.

GOOSE:
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.

ICE:
Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?

MAVERICK:
I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger...

VIPER:
Is that how you remember it?

VIPER:
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?

JESTER:
Just below ten thousand.

VIPER:
But you continued to fight.

VIPER:
Why?

MAVERICK:
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.

VIPER:
The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?

JESTER:
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.

VIPER:
Tell me one thing.

JESTER:
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable  nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.

VIPER:
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   Maverick!

GOOSE:
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.

HOLLYWOOD:
Come on. I died enough for one night.

MAVERICK:
What would you say, too fast...too quick...

CHARLIE:
And far too aggressive.

MAVERICK:
It is combat. Every second counts.

MAVERICK:
Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something.  I'm sorry.

CHARLIE:
For what?

MAVERICK:
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.

CHARLIE:
Apology acknowledged.

MAVERICK:
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?

MAVERICK:
Um. You.

CHARLIE:
There you go with those moves again.

MAVERICK:
Too aggressive?

CHARLIE:
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.

MAVERICK:
I'm special.

CHARLIE:
Yes. I'll give you that!

MAVERICK:
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.

CHARLIE:
I can't.

MAVERICK:
I thought there was something... That night in the club...

CHARLIE:
Lieutenant...

MAVERICK:
Evan... or Maverick.

CHARLIE:
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.

MAVERICK:
The what?

CHARLIE:
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?

MAVERICK:
What are you talking about?

CHARLIE:
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.

MAVERICK:
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.

MAVERICK:
Harmless!

CHARLIE:
Uh hum.

MAVERICK:
What if he's not?

CHARLIE:
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.

CHARLIE:
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...

MAVERICK:
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?

CHARLIE:
How about what?

MAVERICK:
How about anything, anything you want to do.

CHARLIE:
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...

MAVERICK:
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.

CHARLIE:
What about the plane?

MAVERICK:
What plane.

CHARLIE:
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.

CHARLIE:
Used to what?

MAVERICK:
I'm different.

CHARLIE:
I'm starting to sense that now.

MAVERICK:
Let's make it at eight.

CHARLIE:
Make what?

MAVERICK:
Anything.

CHARLIE:
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.

CHARLIE:
Why'd you do that?

m220:
MAVERICK 

MAVERICK:
It dies. We live.

CHARLIE:
You're an animal.

MAVERICK:
That's true. What are you?

CHARLIE:
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.

CHARLIE:
No!

MAVERICK:
It's not suffering anymore.

CHARLIE:
You're horrible

MAVERICK:
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.

CHARLIE:
You don't have to kill it.

MAVERICK:
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.

CHARLIE:
You ever think about killing another human being?

MAVERICK:
About as much as they think about killing me.

CHARLIE:
Does it bother you?

MAVERICK:
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.

MAVERICK:
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.

CHARLIE:
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.

MAVERICK:
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.

CHARLIE:
Winston Churchill.

CHARLIE:
What he said...There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result.

MAVERICK:
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.

CHARLIE:
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.

CHARLIE:
Are you really that brave?

MAVERICK:
I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.

CHARLIE:
It's just as I thought.

MAVERICK:
What?

CHARLIE:
You're totally insane.

MAVERICK:
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.

GOOSE:
Come on, we're next.

MAVERICK:
What?

GOOSE:
Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.

GOOSE:
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.

MAVERICK:
I've had enough...for now.

MAVERICK:
Come on.

CHARLIE:
Where?

MAVERICK:
You want to go ballistic?

CHARLIE:
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.

MAVERICK:
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.

CHARLIE:
And now?

MAVERICK:
And now I want you.

CHARLIE:
You always get what you want?

MAVERICK:
I don't know yet.

CHARLIE:
I want it understood.

MAVERICK:
Anything.

CHARLIE:
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.

MAVERICK:
Why?

CHARLIE:
I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work.

MAVERICK:
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.

VIPER:
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!

GOOSE:
What the hell is this?

MAVERICK:
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.

HOLLYWOOD:
I was a victim of circumstance.

GOOSE:
They should have warned you about that one.

HOLLYWOOD:
She's kinky for flight suitssaid that she'd never seen so many zippersplayed with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.

GOOSE:
What'd you do?

HOLLYWOOD:
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.

WOLFMAN:
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.

HOLLYWOOD:
That's because you don't have any women.

WOLFMAN:
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?

HOLLYWOOD:
The girl with the purple fingernails?

WOLFMAN:
That's hertall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.

MAVERICK:
It was bad.

WOLFMAN:
Bad?

MAVERICK:
The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.

HOLLYWOOD:
Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the sonofabitch who ruined his sister.

WOLFMAN:
I didn't ruin her.

MAVERICK:
You didn't help.

WOLFMAN:
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?

HOLLYWOOD:
Hear about Ice?

WOLFMAN:
What now?

HOLLYWOOD:
He won again.

GOOSE:
Something bothering you?

MAVERICK:
Nothing. Let's just go fight.

MAVERICK:
Morning, Coogan.

WOLFMAN:
How's it goin', Coog?

MAVERICK:
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!

GOOSE:
Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!

VIPER:
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..

MAVERICK:
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

GOOSE:
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!

MAVERICK:
I'm gonna take him, Goose.

GOOSE:
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.

MAVERICK:
I want him!

GOOSE:
What what are you doing? We're cover!

MAVERICK:
Wood's okay. I want Viper.

VIPER:
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.

JESTER:
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.

VIPER:
Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.

MAVERICK:
I lost.

VIPER:
Of course you did. I said a great flyer, not a smart one. You fly reckless. Great instincts. No discipline. That ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. Of course you got killed...and well deserved to. It was a really stupid mistake. In battle, it gets people killed.

MAVERICK:
I can take care of myself.

VIPER:
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?

MAVERICK:
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.

VIPER:
Then why are you here?

MAVERICK:
For the same reason you are.

VIPER:
Oh, you mean the thrill!

MAVERICK:
The flying. The fighting.  I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good.  Just give me the jet.

GOOSE:
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.

MAVERICK:
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.

GOOSE:
Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the...

MAVERICK:
Food...and you...my F14!

CHARLIE:
In that order?

MAVERICK:
Well no...inverse order.

CHARLIE:
I'm still second best.

MAVERICK:
You ever fly an F14?

CHARLIE:
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.

CHARLIE:
Danger?

MAVERICK:
. Yeah!

CHARLIE:
Doesn't it ever bother you?

MAVERICK:
Why, what's gonna happen?

MAVERICK:
Lucky charm.

CHARLIE:
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.

MAVERICK:
Just good luck.

CHARLIE:
Where'd you get it.

MAVERICK:
Pawn shop. What's to eat?

ICE:
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.

MAVERICK:
SHIT!!

MAVERICK:
COME OFF RIGHTCOME OFF HIGHI'M INI'LL ENGAGE.

ICE:
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.

ICE:
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.

MAVERICK:
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.

ICE:
GET LOST!

MAVERICK:
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL  I'M COMING IN.

ICE:
IT'S MY SHOT.

MAVERICK:
COME OFFCOME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.

ICE:
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.

MAVERICK:
YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.

MAVERICK:
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.

ICE:
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.

MAVERICK:
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.

ICE:
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.

MAVERICK:
I'm pinned to the panel.

GOOSE:
Time to go.

MAVERICK:
I can't eject.

GOOSE:
3000 feet. I'll do it.

MAVERICK:
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!

GOOSE:
1000.

MAVERICK:
Let's go. Eject.

VIPER:
How do you feel?

MAVERICK:
All right.

VIPER:
Goose is dead.

MAVERICK:
I know. I was there.

MAVERICK:
He was...my responsibilitymy RIO.

VIPER:
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be othersyou can count on it.

CHARLIE:
...they say you're alright.

MAVERICK:
I'm fine.

CHARLIE:
This is it, then.

MAVERICK:
What?

CHARLIE:
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?

MAVERICK:
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.

CHARLIE:
That's not what I hear.

MAVERICK:
I was flying...my responsibility.

CHARLIE:
That's what you get flight pay for.

MAVERICK:
Maybe I shouldn't take it.

CHARLIE:
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.

MAVERICK:
Not to me.

CHARLIE:
You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part.

MAVERICK:
Where are we?

CHARLIE:
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.

MAVERICK:
You don't have to do this.

CHARLIE:
Do what, show you a good time?

MAVERICK:
I'm not good company. I should be alone.

CHARLIE:
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...

MAVERICK:
No.

CHARLIE:
What do you want?

MAVERICK:
I want it back.

CHARLIE:
What?

MAVERICK:
Yesterday.

CHARLIE:
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.

MAVERICK:
That's what I want.

CHARLIE:
Of course the line's just imaginary. You can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.

CHARLIE:
You don't believe that.

MAVERICK:
Hardly ever.

CHARLIE:
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.

MAVERICK:
It does.

CHARLIE:
Everything passes. Immutable law of the Universe.

MAVERICK:
What do you do when you come here?

CHARLIE:
I sit. I think. I play games.

MAVERICK:
What kind of games?

CHARLIE:
I like to play reality.

MAVERICK:
How do you play reality.

CHARLIE:
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.

MAVERICK:
Strip reality! How do you play that?

CHARLIE:
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.

MAVERICK:
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.

CHARLIE:
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...

CHARLIE:
Want to play the game?

MAVERICK:
How does it go?

CHARLIE:
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?

MAVERICK:
What truth?

CHARLIE:
The big one. The one that's most on your mind.

MAVERICK:
Goose is dead.

CHARLIE:
True.

MAVERICK:
Now?

CHARLIE:
Take something off.

MAVERICK:
Off me or off you?

CHARLIE:
That's up to you.

MAVERICK:
What does it mean?

CHARLIE:
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!

CHARLIE:
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.

MAVERICK:
That's three.

CHARLIE:
And that's one!

MAVERICK:
One more.

CHARLIE:
Your watch.

CHARLIE:
Looks like a tie.

MAVERICK:
Who's gonna win?

CHARLIE:
We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...

FUNGUS:
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOUHEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?

MAVERICK:
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.

FUNGUS:
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?

MAVERICK:
NO. NO GOOD.

JESTER:
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.

VIPER:
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.

JESTER:
I've seen this before.

VIPER:
So have I.

JESTER:
Some guys never get it back.

FUNGUS:
What are you doing?

MAVERICK:
Saving them some paperwork.

FUNGUS:
Since when did you care about paperwork?

FUNGUS:
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!

MAVERICK:
Not anymore.

FUNGUS:
So, you're scaredso what? You ever get a good look at me in the back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.

CHARLIE:
You weren't gonna say goodbye?

MAVERICK:
I was, later.

CHARLIE:
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.

MAVERICK:
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..

CHARLIE:
I know exactly what you mean.

MAVERICK:
How could you?

CHARLIE:
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself. That about it?

MAVERICK:
...Something like that.

CHARLIE:
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...

MAVERICK:
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.

CHARLIE:
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.

MAVERICK:
I hope you find him.

CHARLIE:
I think I have... I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.

MAVERICK:
Skipper, sorry to bother you.

VIPER:
No bother.

MAVERICK:
I called your house.

VIPER:
My wife's house.

MAVERICK:
She said you took your kid to the each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y'have the option... What about me?

VIPER:
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except CNC course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.

MAVERICK:
Or....

VIPER:
Or you can quit.

MAVERICK:
I don't know...

VIPER:
I didn't know either. That's why I told Jester to prepare your papers.

VIPER:
It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...

MAVERICK:
You think I should quit?!

VIPER:
I didn't say that. That's up to you. But I have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you. They need to know you're all right...that they can depend on you.

VIPER:
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.

MAVERICK:
I know.

VIPER:
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.

MAVERICK:
I'm nothing like him.

VIPER:
You may not think so, but you are.

MAVERICK:
He was by the book, all the way.

VIPER:
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.

MAVERICK:
I never heard that.

VIPER:
Not something they tell dependents.

MAVERICK:
It's not true.

MAVERICK:
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.

VIPER:
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no tradeoff. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.

MAVERICK:
You think I shouldn't fly.

VIPER:
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.

MAVERICK:
Would you take me back? Would they?

VIPER:
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.

WOLFMAN:
I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.

HOLLYWOOD:
GOT 'EM.

FUNGUS:
Bandit at seven o'clock lowsolo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!

MAVERICK:
Okay, okay.

FUNGUS:
Don't tell me okay. Do it!

FUNGUS:
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!

MAVERICK:
BREAKING LEFT!

MAVERICK:
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.

ICE:
LOOK OUT!

ICE:
ON THE NOSE?

MAVERICK:
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.

FUNGUS:
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!

MAVERICK:
I GOT ONE COMING UP.

FUNGUS:
AND HE'S GUNNING.

FUNGUS:
Ohhh Mother!

MAVERICK:
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.

FUNGUS:
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?

MAVERICK:
Roger, I've got it.

FUNGUS:
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?

MAVERICK:
Yawing right.

FUNGUS:
I know!

MAVERICK:
Rudder's left, stick's forward.

FUNGUS:
Swell! Passing ten thousand!

MAVERICK:
I've got it  hold on!

FUNGUS:
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!

MAVERICK:
I can recover. Hold on!

FUNGUS:
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.

MAVERICK:
Okay.

MAVERICK:
No! Not again!

FUNGUS:
What are you talking about, we gotta go!

MAVERICK:
I'm not losing it again!

FUNGUS:
Gotta go, man.

MAVERICK:
280, 290, 300 knots.

FUNGUS:
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!

MAVERICK:
You go. I'm staying with it.

FUNGUS:
I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...

MAVERICK:
I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.

ICE:
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?

MAVERICK:
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.

ICE:
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.

MAVERICK:
WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2

FUNGUS:
Is there something I should know?

MAVERICK:
Just relax.

FUNGUS:
Is it the plane?

MAVERICK:
The plane is fine.

FUNGUS:
Is it you?

MAVERICK:
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!

FUNGUS:
You're not supposed to...

MAVERICK:
But I have to!

FUNGUS:
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.

MAVERICK:
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.

ICE:
I guess I owe you one.

MAVERICK:
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.

ICE:
You saved our lives. You did it!

MAVERICK:
We did it.

ICE:
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.

MAVERICK:
No. You can be mine!

FUNGUS:
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???

MAVERICK:
Well what?

FUNGUS:
What do you want?

MAVERICK:
What do I want?

FUNGUS:
What do you want?

MAVERICK:
Any more MiGs?

JESTER:
Who's the hell is that?

VIPER:
Three guesses.

JESTER:
Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet.

MAVERICK:
Let me do the talking.

FUNGUS:
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!

CHARLIE:
Well?

MAVERICK:
Well what?

CHARLIE:
You got your F14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?

MAVERICK:
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?

CHARLIE:
I live here, remember?

MAVERICK:
Right on the flight line?

BACON:
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.

EDDY:
The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.

TOM:
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.

NICK:
Of course you are. All right, Ed.

NICK:
How much did you say it was, Tom?

TOM:
You know how much it is, Nick.

NICK:
And that does include the amp?

TOM:
You know it doesn't include the amp.

TOM:
What have you come as?

SOAP:
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.

TOM:
If you will order stuff that comes from KatManFuckingDu don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route.  Never mind that, what about the money?

SOAP:
Get your fingers out of my soup!

TOM:
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.

BACON:
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. '  Cut from completed film.

EDDY:
Are you sure you can afford twentyfive?

SOAP:
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?

TOM:
Who's this fat man, then?

EDDY:
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.

HATCHET:
You got it all?

EDDY:
A hundred grand.

TOM:
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.

EDDY:
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.

SOAP:
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that illfated individuals owe for an array of reasons.

BACON:
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.

EDDY:
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man Barry the Baptist.

BACON:
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.

HATCHET:
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.

BARRY:
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.

HATCHET:
Where did he get a hundred grand?

HATCHET:
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?

BARRY:
No mortgage, no debts lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.

HATCHET:
Good, you can get this under control now.

BARRY:
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?

HATCHET:
Don't play innocent with me Bazza spanking!

BACON:
Twentyfive from me, Tom, Soap and yourself a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.

EDDY:
I still will, if you don't mind.

TOM:
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twentyfive grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.

SOAP:
That's going on optimism.

TOM:
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.

SOAP:
You're not funny Tom you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.

EDDY:
Because it's cheap like a budgie.

BACON:
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to a bit antisocial, you know.

TOM:
What do you mean?

EDDY:
He means they're thieving dogs.

BIG CHRIS:
How long has he been in there, son?

LITTLE CHRIS:
About twenty minutes.

BIG CHRIS:
Is he on his own?

LITTLE CHRIS:
Just carrying a bag.

BIG CHRIS:
Let's have a look, shall we?

LITTLE CHRIS:
It's not him, Dad.

BIG CHRIS:
Try that one.

BIG CHRIS:
Mind your language in front of my boy.

JOHN O'DRISCOLL:
Jesus Christ!

BIG CHRIS:
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.

JOHN O'DRISCOLL:
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.

BIG CHRIS:
Son, have a look in his locker.

JOHN O'DRISCOLL:
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?

TOM:
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.

SOAP:
Tom, you're all heart.

TOM:
Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays it's in all our interests.

WILLY:
Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?

WINSTON:
The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.

WINSTON:
What are you carrying, Willy?

WILLY:
Er, fertilizer.

WINSTON:
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.

WILLY:
We need fertilizer, Winston.

WINSTON:
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?

WILLY:
What do you mean?

WINSTON:
I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average horterfuckingculturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.

TOM:
What the hell are you doing here?

EDDY:
Why, what's up?

TOM:
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!

GARY:
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?

BARRY:
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep it's yours.

GARY:
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.

BARRY:
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.

DEAN:
Like what?

BARRY:
Like antiques.

DEAN:
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?

BARRY:
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.

GARY:
So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?

BARRY:
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.

GARY:
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?

BARRY:
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.

GARY:
I hate these Southern shites.

BARRY:
Fucking Northern monkeys.

DOORMAN:
Invitations.

EDDY:
Invitations?

DOORMAN:
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.

EDDY:
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?

DOORMAN:
All right, just you the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.

EDDY:
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .

DOORMAN:
Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.

HATCHET:
You must be Eddy. JD's son.

EDDY:
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.

HATCHET:
Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.

BACON:
What's that?

SAMOAN JO:
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.

BACON:
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest you could fall in love with an orangutan in that.

SAMOAN JO:
You want a pint, go to the pub.

BACON:
I thought this was a pub.

SAMOAN JO:
It's a Samoan pub.

BACON:
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?

SAMOAN JO:
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.

DEAN:
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?

GARY:
All right, Kenny.

DEAN:
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?

GARY:
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.

DEAN:
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!

BARRY:
You get the guns?

DEAN:
You should see what they did to poor Gary.

EDDY:
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.

HATCHET:
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY

HATCHET:
I will.

EDDY:
You will what?

HATCHET:
I will loan you the money.

EDDY:
I think I would rather just turn them over.

HATCHET:
I am not interested in what you would rather I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.

EDDY:
I need two hundred and fifty grand.

HATCHET:
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.

EDDY:
That's if I want to see you.

HATCHET:
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.

EDDY:
I'll see ya.

HATCHET:
For half a million?

EDDY:
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.

HATCHET:
And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?

TOM:
I'll kill him!

BACON:
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?

BACON:
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteeninch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.

EDDY:
I'll think of something, don't worry.

BACON:
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.

SOAP:
I would rather put my money on a threelegged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?

BACON:
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days it's hit him hard.

SOAP:
It's hit us all hard!

BACON:
Yeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.

BACON:
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?

TOM:
Probably no longer than four weeks.

BACON:
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?

TOM:
Well, it's still a good idea.

DOG:
So do you know these geezers well?

PLANK:
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.

DOG:
What they like then?

PLANK:
Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.

PLANK:
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.

DOG:
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?

PLANK:
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.

DOG:
Is there no way they can get back to you?

PLANK:
Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle they're gutless faggots.

SOAP:
Well, what do you want us to do about it?

EDDY:
Hit the fuckers.

BACON:
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.

EDDY:
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?

SOAP:
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?

EDDY:
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!

SOAP:
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .

EDDY:
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...

EDDY:
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.

SOAP:
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.

EDDY:
No, just one of them is in charge of them going to the job. So I assume he will still

SOAP:
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuckups?

TOM:
It's the mother of fuckups, stupid!

SOAP:
Well, excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any difference, they are still fucking guns, and they still fire fucking bullets!

TOM:
Not normal weed. This is some fuckedup skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.

NICK:
Doesn't sound very good to me.

TOM:
Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's on and burning bright for the masses.

NICK:
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.

TOM:
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawnoff shotguns.

NICK:
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?

TOM:
I think you're Nick the Greek.

DEAN:
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.

BARRY:
Where're the others?

DEAN:
There are no others.

BARRY:
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?

DEAN:
I don't know what you mean.

BARRY:
There were two old guns there where are they?

DEAN:
Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammerlock muskets the butler was carrying they were ours, and we sold 'em!

BARRY:
Well you just better unsell 'em, sharpish.

DEAN:
They were . . .

BARRY:
I am not fucking interested.

TOM:
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?

NICK:
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.

TOM:
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?

NICK:
Seven hundred each.

NICK:
Sawnoffs are out, Tom people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.

TOM:
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.

NICK:
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.

TOM:
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?

NICK:
Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy.

JD:
Go on.

HATCHET:
I like your bar.

JD:
Yes?

HATCHET:
I want your bar.

JD:
And?

HATCHET:
Do you want me to draw a picture?

JD:
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his earhole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.

HATCHET:
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.

JD:
And you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!

PLANK:
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.

DOG:
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.

DOG:
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?

PLANK:
No.

DOG:
And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?

EDDY:
Yes?

BACON:
It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.

SOAP:
Where did you get those from, a museum?

TOM:
Nick the Greek.

BACON:
How much did you part with?

TOM:
Seven hundred for the pair.

SOAP:
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.

BACON:
Jesus, Tom, do they work?

TOM:
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.

EDDY:
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.

TOM:
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?

BACON:
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.

SOAP:
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.

EDDY:
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?

J:
Hello, can I help you?

PLANK:
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?

J:
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.

PLANK:
Well, perhaps you can help?

J:
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.

PLANK:
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?

J:
I can't help you, Plank.

PLANK:
I think you'll find it is in your interest.

J:
Hold on. OK.  Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our interest.

WINSTON:
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.

DOG:
What the fuck is going on?

PLANK:
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.

J:
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.

PLANK:
Lives and learns doesn't one.

J:
Sorry, got to do business like this now can't be too careful these days.

PLANK:
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.

J:
What are you doing, Plank?

PLANK:
What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.

m422:
DOG 

PLANK:
Just hold on, I got the keys.

DOG:
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?

PLANK:
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.

WINSTON:
J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.

DOG:
Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.

PLANK:
It must be this one.

DOG:
Just give me the keys.

PLANK:
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.

DOG:
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.

DOG:
Right, his leg's going now.

WINSTON:
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.

DOG:
And all your friends, there's a good lad.

WINSTON:
There is only three of us here.

DOG:
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?

WINSTON:
I mean it, there is only three of us here.

DOG:
Plank?

PLANK:
Yeah, one of them's out.

DOG:
OK, open the gate.

DOG:
Where?

WINSTON:
Out the back.

DOG:
And the weed?

WINSTON:
Out the back.

TRAFFIC WARDEN:
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.

PAUL:
I'll only be a minute.

TRAFFIC WARDEN:
You've already been fifteen.

PAUL:
Look. Go on, look.

TRAFFIC WARDEN:
At what, exactly?

PAUL:
My van is half full.

TRAFFIC WARDEN:
So?

PAUL:
So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.

PLANK:
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?

DOG:
How about you? All right?

EDDY:
Everything all right out there, Tom?

TOM:
Right as rain.

EDDY:
Where the hell are we supposed to hide?

SOAP:
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.

EDDY:
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.

SOAP:
And look what happened to that.

EDDY:
If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.

BACON:
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.

EDDY:
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.

TOM:
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?

SOAP:
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.

EDDY:
Bacon, see what we got.

BACON:
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed we've got a shit load of cash and we've got a . . . traffic warden.

TOM:
A what?

BACON:
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?

BACON:
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?

EDDY:
I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.

HATCHET:
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?

BIG CHRIS:
No Harry, you can't.

EDDY:
That's it all done, we are off.

SOAP:
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?

EDDY:
There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.

SOAP:
What's left over?'

TOM:
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.

SOAP:
What about all the gear?

DOG:
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.

JOHN:
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.

DOG:
It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.

DOG:
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?

JOHN:
Er well, yes we do.

DOG:
In fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? You could say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking Everest of problems, couldn't you? . . . And the reason it is such a mon fuckingstrosity of a problem is because you don't have the first fucking idea who did this to us, do you?

BACON:
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!

EDDY:
That inspires confidence, that does.

TOM:
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?

SOAP:
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.

TOM:
You would take a pain n the arse full stop.

SOAP:
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.

NICK:
Yeah?

DEAN:
That's no way to answer the phone.

NICK:
Is that you, Dean?

DEAN:
Sure is.

NICK:
What can I do for you?

DEAN:
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.

NICK:
Not likely I am afraid I don't think I'll be seeing them again.

DEAN:
I got the money to pay for 'em.

NICK:
I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand I am not going to see them or the guns again.

BARRY:
You fucking well have to get 'em!

DEAN:
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.

BARRY:
Inside, outfuckin'side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .

DEAN:
Yeah, Bazza, what?

BARRY:
You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Backyouup witha Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?

GARY:
Who was that?

DEAN:
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.

GARY:
Jesus, I have heard about him.

DEAN:
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold we gotta find 'em.

JOHN:
Dog, I have found the cash!

DOG:
The stupid bastards! Count it!

JOHN:
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?

DOG:
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.

JOHN:
But...  Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.

TOM:
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?

SOAP:
Six.

TOM:
How many wings have they got between them?

SOAP:
Twelve.

TOM:
How many feet?

SOAP:
Er, well, twelve.

TOM:
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?

SOAP:
How the fuck should I know?

TOM:
How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?

SOAP:
The money, the gear!

TOM:
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.

SOAP:
OK, don't panic let's think about this.

BIG CHRIS:
Hello, John. Nice holiday?

JOHN O'DRISCOLL:
I won't be seeing you again Chris I have paid him every last penny.

BIG CHRIS:
I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.

BIG CHRIS:
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things wondered if you wanted them?

HATCHET:
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.

HATCHET:
Have you counted the money?

BIG CHRIS:
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.

HATCHET:
They were going to pay, then?

BIG CHRIS:
It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.

HATCHET:
Good job, Chris.

DEAN:
We gotta get those guns.

GARY:
This is dangerous shit, Dean we don't even know who lives in there.

DEAN:
Listen, I don't care who lives in there all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.

GARY:
Furry muff, let's go.

SOAP:
I hope this is the right move.

EDDY:
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.

EDDY:
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.

BACON:
Think about what you're going to say, Ed we are on thin ice.

HATCHET:
That you, boy?

EDDY:
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.

HATCHET:
It's pay day, ain't it?

EDDY:
I wanted to talk to you about that.

HATCHET:
I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!

BACON:
Well?

EDDY:
Well what?

TOM:
Well, what did he say?

EDDY:
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.

SOAP:
You what? What are you on about?

EDDY:
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.

EDDY:
You and me, Tom.

TOM:
What do you mean, me?

EDDY:
Tom, this is our case.

TOM:
. . . What?

EDDY:
This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.

EDDY:
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.

TOM:
I'11 meet you in the car.

EDDY:
Tom?

TOM:
I'll only be a minute.

BIG CHRIS:
Son?

DOG:
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?

BIG CHRIS:
You all right back there, mate?

DOG:
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?

BIG CHRIS:
It's in an office I have just left it in the office. 137

DOG:
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chopfuckin'chop.

BIG CHRIS:
All right, furry muff.

DOG:
What are you doing?

BIG CHRIS:
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.

DOG:
You had better be careful.

SOAP:
Well, what's going on?

EDDY:
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.

EDDY:
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.

BACON:
Apart from those shotguns.

EDDY:
And Tom took care of them.

TOM:
I wanted to talk to you about that.

BACON:
Well, talk.

TOM:
Well not exactly, no I got 'em sitting in the car, actually I thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him.

EDDY:
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?

TOM:
We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?

SOAP:
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.

EDDY:
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.

BIG CHRIS:
JD.

JD:
Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?

BIG CHRIS:
Nope.

JD:
Can I help?

BIG CHRIS:
I think I can help you, as it happens.

JD:
Yes?

BIG CHRIS:
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.

JD:
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.

BIG CHRIS:
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money loaning business, all right, son?

LITTLE CHRIS:
All right, Dad.

BIG CHRIS:
Well, put your seatbelt on then.

EDDY:
There's nothing in it!

SOAP:
What do you mean?

EDDY:
I mean it's fucking empty.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
You feel it?

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
Yeah.

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
Yeah, they showed me

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
Could be unrelated.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
That's what I'm thinkin'.

HERB:
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?

DAN:
I just wanted to come here.

HERB:
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?

DAN:
This Denny's.

HERB:
Okay. Why this Denny's?

DAN:
It's kind of embarrassing but,

HERB:
Go ahead.

DAN:
I had a dream about this place.

HERB:
Oh boy.

DAN:
You see what I mean...

HERB:
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.

DAN:
Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is  there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream.

HERB:
So, you came to see if he's out there?

DAN:
To get rid of this godawful feeling.

HERB:
Right then.

COCO:
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.

BETTY:
Yes, he is. He raises corn.

COCO:
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.

BETTY:
Well, I ...

COCO:
You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called tits and ass.

BETTY:
I...

COCO:
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.

BETTY:
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.

COCO:
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.

BETTY:
I guess I've come to quite a place.

COCO:
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.

BETTY:
No, I don't.

COCO:
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.

BETTY:
I can hardly wait, Coco.

BETTY:
It's unbelievable!

COCO:
I told ya.

BETTY:
Wow!

COCO:
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.

BETTY:
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.

COCO:
You got it! See you later honey.

DARKHAIRED WOMAN:
That's okay.

BETTY:
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.

DARKHAIRED WOMAN:
There was an accident. I came here.

BETTY:
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?

DARKHAIRED WOMAN:
A car ... a car accident.

BETTY:
Are you okay?

DARKHAIRED WOMAN:
I think so. I was just taking a shower.

BETTY:
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.

DARKHAIRED WOMAN:
My name is Rita.

BETTY:
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?

RITA:
No ..........I.

BETTY:
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.

RITA:
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.

BETTY:
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.

RITA:
I think I've been hurt.

BETTY:
Oh...

RITA:
No.

BETTY:
But, this could be serious.

RITA:
No...I need to sleep.

BETTY:
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.

RITA:
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.

BETTY:
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.

JOE:
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.

ED:
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?

JOE:
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.

ED:
Making ends meet, huh.

JOE:
Hardly.

ED:
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.

JOE:
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.

ED:
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.

JOE:
Yeah, that's a funny story.

ADAM:
So what's the problem?

RAY:
There is no problem.

ADAM:
So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.

RAY:
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.

ADAM:
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.

ADAM:
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!

RAY:
I'll speak to someone.

ADAM:
And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a setup to me!  And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!

BETTY:
What is it Rita?

RITA:
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...

BETTY:
What's wrong?

RITA:
I don't know who I am.

BETTY:
What do you mean? You're Rita.

RITA:
I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!

BILLY:
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.

JOE:
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.

BILLY:
My next delivery is up that way, so I'll be getting down to it real soon.

JOE:
You're so easy.

BILLY:
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.

JOE:
Yeah, what for?

BILLY:
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.

JOE:
What's  the matter now?

BILLY:
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.

JOE:
It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.

LANEY:
Not here...no thanks.

JOE:
Not a coke or anything?

LANEY:
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.

JOE:
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.

LANEY:
No.  I haven't seen any.

JOE:
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?

LANEY:
No...

JOE:
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?

LANEY:
Sure.

BETTY:
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?

RITA:
What do you mean?

BETTY:
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?

RITA:
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.

BETTY:
How do you remember how to talk?

RITA:
I don't know.

BETTY:
You don't remember anything else?

RITA:
No  There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it.  There are things there.... but I'm... here.

BETTY:
The money. You don't know where it came from?

RITA:
Unh, unh.

BETTY:
When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?

CYNTHIA:
Adam, where are you?

ADAM:
What's going on, Cynthia?

CYNTHIA:
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.

ADAM:
What did you say?

CYNTHIA:
They fired everyone.

ADAM:
Who fired everyone?

CYNTHIA:
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!

ADAM:
No.

CYNTHIA:
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.

ADAM:
I'm going home.

CYNTHIA:
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!

ADAM:
I'm going home Cynthia.

CYNTHIA:
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.

ADAM:
I'm going home. I'll call you later.

RITA:
Mulholland Drive.

BETTY:
Mulholland Drive?

RITA:
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.

BETTY:
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.

RITA:
No.... I don't...

BETTY:
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.

RITA:
Okay... but just...just to see.

BETTY:
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.

RITA:
Okay.

BETTY:
Come on... let's find you something to wear.

BETTY:
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.

SERGEANT BAXTER:
Yes, there was.

BETTY:
Can you tell me what happened?

SERGEANT BAXTER:
No. I can't.

BETTY:
Was anyone hurt?

SERGEANT BAXTER:
May I have your name please?

RITA:
There's nothing?

BETTY:
Not that I can see.

RITA:
No. Just the coffee.

BETTY:
We'll take our check.

BETTY:
Strange to be calling yourself.

RITA:
Maybe it's not me.

BETTY:
Call the number.

RITA:
It's not my voice ... but I know her.

BETTY:
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.

RITA:
Maybe...maybe ... maybe.

BETTY:
What's wrong with that?

RITA:
I'm not sure about this.

BETTY:
I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.

ADAM:
Yes...what is it?

HOTEL MANAGER:
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.

ADAM:
... What??

HOTEL MANAGER:
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.

ADAM:
How...  how'd they know I was here?

HOTEL MANAGER:
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.

ADAM:
So, what did they say?

HOTEL MANAGER:
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.

ADAM:
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?

HOTEL MANAGER:
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.

ADAM:
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.

HOTEL MANAGER:
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.

ADAM:
Someone's shut off my money!

CYNTHIA:
I know.  Where are you Adam?

ADAM:
What do you mean you know?

CYNTHIA:
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.

ADAM:
And?

CYNTHIA:
You're broke!

ADAM:
But I'm not broke.

CYNTHIA:
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?

ADAM:
Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.

CYNTHIA:
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?

ADAM:
The Cowboy??

CYNTHIA:
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.

ADAM:
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?

CYNTHIA:
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.

ADAM:
Cynthia...what's going on?

CYNTHIA:
It's been a very strange day.

ADAM:
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?

CYNTHIA:
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.

ADAM:
You gotta be kidding?

CYNTHIA:
Will you meet with him?

ADAM:
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?

CYNTHIA:
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.

ADAM:
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.

CYNTHIA:
I'm just offering a place to stay.

ADAM:
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.

CYNTHIA:
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.

ADAM:
Git along little dowgie and call me back.

COWBOY:
Howdy!

ADAM:
Howdy to you.

COWBOY:
Beautiful night.

ADAM:
Yeah.

COWBOY:
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.

ADAM:
No problem. What's on your mind?

COWBOY:
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?

ADAM:
Whatever.

COWBOY:
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?

ADAM:
Sure.

COWBOY:
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?

ADAM:
I agree with what you said...truly.

COWBOY:
What did I say?

ADAM:
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.

COWBOY:
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.

ADAM:
How's that?

COWBOY:
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?

ADAM:
Okay, I'm thinking.

COWBOY:
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?

ADAM:
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?

COWBOY:
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?

ADAM:
One.

COWBOY:
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.

ADAM:
Okay.

COWBOY:
Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault...

ADAM:
It will work out.

COWBOY:
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?

ADAM:
I understand.

COWBOY:
You're an understandin' fella.

ADAM:
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?

COWBOY:
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.

ADAM:
Okay.

BETTY:
You're still here?

RITA:
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.

RITA:
Really?

BETTY:
My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left...

RITA:
So... surprise...

BETTY:
I can call them... I can call my dad... 

RITA:
But you won't...

BETTY:
You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work.

RITA:
You know what I want...it's not that difficult.

BETTY:
Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... 

RITA:
What about you? What will your dad think about you?

BETTY:
Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...

RITA:
Before what?

BETTY:
Before I kill you.

RITA:
Then they'd put you in jail.

BETTY:
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?

RITA:
I'm all right.

BETTY:
You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.

COCO:
Your Aunt called me.

BETTY:
I was afraid of that.

COCO:
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.

BETTY:
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...

COCO:
Sweetie, look at me straight.

BETTY:
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.

COCO:
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.

BETTY:
Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.

BETTY:
You're really something Coco...thank you.

COCO:
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble  get rid of it.

RITA:
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?

BETTY:
Everything is Aokay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
Nice wallets.

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
The one of 'em still alive?

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
Oh yeah.

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knifelike torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain  all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
Find out who they are?

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
Interesting.

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
Where at?

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
Palmdale.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
Damn, that's a long drive.

BETTY:
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke.

RITA:
Good luck!

BETTY:
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.

RITA:
Okay.

BETTY:
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.

COCO:
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?

BETTY:
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.

COCO:
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.

BETTY:
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing

COCO:
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.

BETTY:
Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.

COCO:
Get going. You don't want to be late.

BETTY:
Right. See ya.

COCO:
Good luck, honey!

BETTY:
To my audition.

PARAMOUNT GUARD:
And who are we auditioning for today?

BETTY:
Wally Brown.

PARAMOUNT GUARD:
And do we know which of the fiftyseven buildings Wally Brown is in?

BETTY:
No, we don't.

PARAMOUNT GUARD:
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?

BETTY:
Yes, Sir.

PARAMOUNT GUARD:
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?

BETTY:
Betty Elms.

PARAMOUNT GUARD:
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.

BETTY:
Thank you... thank you very much.

WALLY:
Betty Elms?

BETTY:
Yes.

WALLY:
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.

BETTY:
Very pleased to meet you.

WALLY:
Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.

BETTY:
Hi.

WALLY:
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?

BETTY:
No, no, I'm fine.

WALLY:
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?

JIMMY:
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.

BETTY:
What?

JIMMY:
I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?

BETTY:
Betty.

JIMMY:
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.

BETTY:
You're still here?

JIMMY:
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.

BETTY:
I can call them... I can call my dad.

JIMMY:
But you won't.

BETTY:
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...

JIMMY:
Before what?

BETTY:
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!

RITA:
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.

BETTY:
You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.

RITA:
Don't stop!

BETTY:
What is it? What do you see?!

RITA:
Those men in front, in the car.

BETTY:
Do you know them?!

RITA:
No... but...

BETTY:
Keep going. Go around to the back.

MIDDLEAGED WOMAN:
Yes?

BETTY:
Diane?

MIDDLEAGED WOMAN:
Number 17.

BETTY:
But it said 12.

MIDDLEAGED WOMAN:
I switched apartments with her. She's in 17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.

BETTY:
Well ... we'll leave her a note.

MIDDLEAGED WOMAN:
I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.

RITA:
I don't think...

BETTY:
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.

RITA:
No.

BETTY:
Rita... I know what you're doing.

RITA:
What ... I..HAVE... to do.

BETTY:
I know what you have to do, but let me do it.

BETTY:
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.

RITA:
But I want to.

BETTY:
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.

RITA:
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.

BETTY:
Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.

FATHER MCFEELY:
Uh... I'm Father McFeely

MOTHER:
Father, come in, please.

MOTHER:
I'm so glad you're here.

FATHER MCFEELY:
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...

MOTHER:
It's okay. I understand.

FATHER MCFEELY:
How is she?

MOTHER:
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.

FATHER MCFEELY:
Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.

HARRIS:
Father.

FATHER MCFEELY:
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.

HARRIS:
Would you like to see the girl?

FATHER MCFEELY:
Soon. First, I must bless this house.

HARRIS:
Father, are you okay?

FATHER MCFEELY:
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?

HARRIS:
Yes.

FATHER MCFEELY:
Then let us prepare.

FATHER MCFEELY:
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.

HARRIS:
Because she will lie?

FATHER MCFEELY:
No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.

FATHER MCFEELY:
Oh shit, you gonna take that?

HARRIS:
What?

FATHER MCFEELY:
What she said about your mother?

HARRIS:
No thanks.

FATHER MCFEELY:
My holy water.

HARRIS:
Father, I think you should rest.

FATHER MCFEELY:
No, I'm fine.

CINDY:
So, do you think you made it into the class?

SHORTY:
I don't know, but I sure hope so.

CINDY:
You could use the grade, huh?

SHORTY:
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?

CINDY:
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.

SHORTY:
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.

CINDY:
Huh?

SHORTY:
Gear. You know, clothing.

CINDY:
Oh.

SHORTY:
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.

CINDY:
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...

SHORTY:
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.

CINDY:
Yo! That jacket is tight.

SHORTY:
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!

CINDY:
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!

SHORTY:
Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.

CINDY:
Am I cool now?

SHORTY:
Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.

RAY:
I woke up naked, too.

TOMMY:
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.

RAY:
What does it say?

TOMMY:
It says, Ray.

RAY:
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.

TOMMY:
Get out?! What does it say?

RAY:
Fucked me.

TOMMY:
Aww. Cool. Dude.

TOMMY:
Ray!

RAY:
Fucked me.

TOMMY:
Ray!

RAY:
Fucked me.

CINDY:
Are you okay?

ALEX:
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.

CINDY:
That's always tough. How long were you together?

ALEX:
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?

CINDY:
No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...

ALEX:
Hey, Brenda.

BRENDA:
Do I know you?

ALEX:
Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, I'm sorry, and you said, Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass. I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy.

CINDY:
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.

BRENDA:
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.

CINDY:
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.

BRENDA:
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.

CINDY:
Really? That's amazing.

BRENDA:
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.

CINDY:
Thanks.

BRENDA:
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?

CINDY:
Psychology.

ALEX:
Me, too. 101?

BRENDA:
In room 302 at ten o'clock?

ALEX:
That's it.

BRENDA:
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.

DWIGHT:
I finished all the interviews.

PROFESSOR:
Let me see the files.

DWIGHT:
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.

PROFESSOR:
Let me help you.

DWIGHT:
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.

DWIGHT:
Here you go, Professor.

PROFESSOR:
Are these all the subjects?

DWIGHT:
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.

PROFESSOR:
Any of them hot?

DWIGHT:
I also took the liberty of putting those with neardeath experiences on top.

PROFESSOR:
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized coeds are a sure thing.

DWIGHT:
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.

PROFESSOR:
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.

DWIGHT:
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.

PROFESSOR:
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?

DWIGHT:
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.

PROFESSOR:
What's this?

PROFESSOR:
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?

DWIGHT:
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.

PROFESSOR:
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.

DWIGHT:
How are we going to get them all up there?

PROFESSOR:
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.

DWIGHT:
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?

PROFESSOR:
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?

DWIGHT:
In about fifteen minutes.

PROFESSOR:
Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.

CINDY:
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...

RAY:
It's okay.

CINDY:
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?

RAY:
It's the sequel.

CINDY:
Oh, right.

RAY:
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.

CINDY:
I am. So just do me a favor and stay away from me.

RAY:
Hello Brenda.

BRENDA:
Hello Ray.

CINDY:
Would you like me to help you pass them back?

DWIGHT:
I don't need your help.

BUDDY:
Hey, you left your book back there.

CINDY:
Thanks. I'm Cindy.

BUDDY:
So, I see you're really into spooks.

CINDY:
No. I never date outside my race.

BUDDY:
I meant you're into ghosts.

CINDY:
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.

BUDDY:
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.

CINDY:
Yeah.

BUDDY:
Maybe we can study together or something.

CINDY:
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.

CINDY:
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.

BUDDY:
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.

CINDY:
Okay. See you later, friend.

CINDY:
Oh my God! I'm here with the...

HANSON:
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.

CINDY:
I'm Cindy.

HANSON:
I'm Hanson the caretaker.

DWIGHT:
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.

PROFESSOR:
Right. What about condoms?

DWIGHT:
Professor!

PROFESSOR:
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.

DWIGHT:
Would you please focus?

PROFESSOR:
Fine.  What's all this stuff?

DWIGHT:
Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.

PROFESSOR:
Are those cameras all throughout the house?

DWIGHT:
Yes, I thought that it would be best.

PROFESSOR:
Even in the bathroom?

PROFESSOR:
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close up?

DWIGHT:
That one.

PROFESSOR:
After dinner, you and I will take shifts throughout the night. I don't want to chance miss anything.

HANSON:
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.

DWIGHT:
Thanks, handyman.

HANSON:
I'm the caretaker, not the handyman.  Nice skates. Be careful. You don't want to fall and break something.

PROFESSOR:
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.

DWIGHT:
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.

CINDY:
Hi Buddy.

BUDDY:
Open chest!!!

DWIGHT:
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.

RAY:
Second best.

CINDY:
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?

PROFESSOR:
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.

PROFESSOR:
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.

DWIGHT:
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.

PROFESSOR:
Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?

CINDY:
How about these buns?

RAY:
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.

CINDY:
Ummm!! They smell delicious.

HANSON:
Thanks. I made them by hand.

HANSON:
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?

DWIGHT:
Yours, or the turkeys?

HANSON:
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?

DWIGHT:
That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.

CINDY:
Professor, what's the history of this house?

PROFESSOR:
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.

PROFESSOR:
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.

BRENDA:
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...

PROFESSOR:
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.

BRENDA:
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.

PROFESSOR:
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.

BRENDA:
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.

PROFESSOR:
He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish.

BRENDA:
Ouch!!

CINDY:
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.

BRENDA:
No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues...

DWIGHT:
My God! Is she dead?

PROFESSOR:
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.

DWIGHT:
Professor, I think you should see this.

PROFESSOR:
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?

DWIGHT:
No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.

DWIGHT:
The image there.

PROFESSOR:
Are you sure it's not the tape?

DWIGHT:
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.

PROFESSOR:
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.

SHORTY:
Aww, the little bird died.

CINDY:
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.

SHORTY:
Hey, I got an idea.

CINDY:
That was a great idea, Shorty.

SHORTY:
I told you it would taste just like chicken.

CINDY:
Did you do that?

SHORTY:
Uh, uh.

CINDY:
You better go get Dwight and the Professor.

PROFESSOR:
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?

CINDY:
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.

DWIGHT:
What the hell are you doing?

CINDY:
Just wait, you'll see.

CINDY:
Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?

PROFESSOR:
It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.

CINDY:
Got my camera right here.

CINDY:
I got it!

PROFESSOR:
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.

CINDY:
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...

BUDDY:
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.

CINDY:
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.

BUDDY:
Then what kinda stuff can we do?

CINDY:
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.

BUDDY:
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?

CINDY:
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?

BUDDY:
Sure. We can practice talking.

CINDY:
Okay.

CINDY:
Buddy...

BUDDY:
Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.

BUDDY:
Dude, somebody's on the rag.

CINDY:
Shhh!

BUDDY:
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.

CINDY:
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?

BUDDY:
Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.

BUDDY:
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...

CINDY:
Alright!

RAY:
Shhh... It's okay.

BRENDA:
Ray, have you been here all this time?

RAY:
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

BRENDA:
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.

RAY:
So, I guess I can go now.

BRENDA:
No, stay.

RAY:
You sure?

BRENDA:
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.

RAY:
Yeah, me too.

BRENDA:
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.

RAY:
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.

THEO:
Are you okay?

CINDY:
I think so.

THEO:
Come on. We better get you cleaned up.

CINDY:
I'm telling you, it was possessed.

PROFESSOR:
Theo, did you see the animal?

THEO:
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.

CINDY:
What, you think I did this to myself?

PROFESSOR:
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.

CINDY:
What are you getting at, Professor?

PROFESSOR:
Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.

PROFESSOR:
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a goodnight kiss.

CINDY:
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.

THEO:
Goodnight, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.

CINDY:
Thanks, I'll be fine.

CINDY:
Got a problem with that?

PROFESSOR:
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?

PROFESSOR:
I take it you're not mad at me.

CINDY:
I wouldn't go that far.

PROFESSOR:
I don't like this, this...

CINDY:
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.

CINDY:
I think she's starting to suspect something?

PROFESSOR:
Who?

CINDY:
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.

PROFESSOR:
Saw who?!

CINDY:
Don't touch me!!

DWIGHT:
What the hell?!

PROFESSOR:
It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.

DWIGHT:
Professor, we need to talk.

PROFESSOR:
What is it, Dwight?

DWIGHT:
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.

PROFESSOR:
What?

DWIGHT:
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.

PROFESSOR:
That's why we came here, remember?

DWIGHT:
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.

PROFESSOR:
Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.

CINDY:
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.

ALEX:
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.

CINDY:
I found a picture of his wife.

ALEX:
Wife?!

CINDY:
Okay, I get the point.

THEO:
So, whatever happened to her?

CINDY:
She killed herself a week before he died.

ALEX:
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.

CINDY:
I think he wants me.

ALEX:
Ha! Right bitch!

THEO:
Hello Dwight.

DWIGHT:
Hi.

THEO:
What are you working on?

DWIGHT:
Just a little experiment.

THEO:
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?

DWIGHT:
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.

THEO:
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.

DWIGHT:
You do.

THEO:
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.

DWIGHT:
And sexy.

THEO:
Of course. So sexy.

THEO:
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?

DWIGHT:
Just a little Rogaine.

THEO:
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.

DWIGHT:
That's right.

THEO:
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?

DWIGHT:
Oh, I couldn't do that.

DWIGHT:
I can do it myself.

PROFESSOR:
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.

DWIGHT:
The keys. She took the keys.

CINDY:
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.

DWIGHT:
Quick, everyone to the lab.

CINDY:
What are we gonna do?

DWIGHT:
We have to destroy him.

RAY:
He's right. I should go first.

BRENDA:
He's so brave.

ALEX:
No, I won't let you do it.

CINDY:
Alex, what are you doing?

ALEX:
Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.

THEO:
Let her go, Cin.

CINDY:
But he'll kill her!

THEO:
That means more screen time for us.

THEO:
She's right. We should stick together.

DWIGHT:
Alright. Come on, you guys.

ALEX:
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.

THEO:
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.

ALEX:
Oh... I guess I'll die now.

THEO:
Okay... maybe that would be best.

ALEX:
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you 

THEO:
Never happened!

ALEX:
My favorite memory was when we 

THEO:
Would you die already?!

BRENDA:
Where's Shorty?

RAY:
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.

BUDDY:
Where the hell are we?

CINDY:
It looks like the furnace.

BUDDY:
Let's get outta here.

CINDY:
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.

BUDDY:
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?

CINDY:
Hugh Kane.

CINDY:
Help!

BRENDA:
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.

CINDY:
Oh my God! We're dead!

BRENDA:
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.

CINDY:
It's coming!

BRENDA:
What?! What is it, a monster?!

BRENDA:
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.

CINDY:
Hey, I have an idea...

CINDY:
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!

BRENDA:
Okay.

BUDDY:
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.

CINDY:
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.

BUDDY:
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...

CINDY:
That we should take our friendship a little further?

BUDDY:
Yes...

CINDY:
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.

BUDDY:
I was thinking the same thing.

CINDY:
We should act out our inner most fantasies.

BUDDY:
Great!!!

CINDY:
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.

BUDDY:
Huh?

CINDY:
What about you, Buddy?

BUDDY:
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.

CINDY:
He's here.

BUDDY:
Shit!

BUDDY:
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.

CINDY:
Can you feel that?

BUDDY:
No. Try a little higher.

CINDY:
Feel that?

BUDDY:
No. Keep rubbing.

BUDDY:
Better try a little higher.

CINDY:
Now, come on  you know I'm not ready for that kind of 

BUDDY:
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.

CINDY:
Well... okay... but only as a friend.

CINDY:
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?

RAY:
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?

CINDY:
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.

RAY:
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?

CINDY:
Right behind you.

CINDY:
Where's Shorty?

RAY:
I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.

CINDY:
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!

HANSON:
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.

HANSON:
Sit down and join us, Cindy.

SHORTY:
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.

CINDY:
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.

SHORTY:
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.

CINDY:
Are you?

SHORTY:
That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?

HANSON:
Now you're being rude, Shorty.

SHORTY:
Washington is full of cornpone country pussy  just ask Jesse Jackson.

HANSON:
Yo son, check this out.

SHORTY:
Dog, you look hot.

CINDY:
Hanson, please.

HANSON:
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.

CINDY:
Stop touching his brain!

HANSON:
Um, I'm not touching anything.

SHORTY:
Sorry, y'all. My bad.

HANSON:
Shorty, why don't you say grace?

SHORTY:
Me? Grace? Okay  Dear God 

HANSON:
This part removes the sense of humor.

SHORTY:
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...

HANSON:
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me Stop. If you loved me you'd stop.

CINDY:
Not in a thousand years.

CINDY:
Stop! 

HANSON:
Made you say it!

BRENDA:
Cindy, what's going on?

CINDY:
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!

RAY:
You never could feel your legs.

DWIGHT:
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.

DWIGHT:
Alright... I might need your help.

RAY:
My help?

DWIGHT:
A little bit... Give me your belt.

RAY:
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.

DWIGHT:
Okay, give me my belt.

RAY:
You're not wearing a belt.

DWIGHT:
Alright, go to the belt store...

DWIGHT:
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.

CINDY:
I'll go.

BUDDY:
Cindy, let me...

CINDY:
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.

BUDDY:
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.

DWIGHT:
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.

CINDY:
Alright, let's take a vote...

BRENDA:
Ray, run faster.

RAY:
Okay.

CINDY:
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?

RAY:
Yeah, I broke my fall.

SHORTY:
Hey, y'all! What's going on?

CINDY:
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?

SHORTY:
That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.

CINDY:
Father!

MCFEELY:
My child, you're alive!

CINDY:
Yes, we made it!

MCFEELY:
We? What do you mean... we?

CINDY:
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....

MCFEELY:
My child you are the only survivor.

CINDY:
No, my friends are right here!

MCFEELY:
I'm sorry.

CINDY:
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?

MCFEELY:
Soon, but first I must bless this house.

RAY:
You mean to tell me we're dead!

DWIGHT:
I guess so.

RAY:
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?

TOMMY:
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.

RAY:
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.

TOMMY:
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.

RAY:
Don't worry, I got your back.

BUDDY:
There's something I really want to share with you.

CINDY:
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.

BUDDY:
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...

CINDY:
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.

BUDDY:
I know, but I've been thinking 

CINDY:
I know, but I've been thinking 

BUDDY:
Listen to me I 

CINDY:
Listen to me I 

BUDDY:
Look, what I'm trying to say 

CINDY:
Look, what I'm trying to say 

BUDDY:
Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.

CINDY:
Oh.

BUDDY:
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.

CINDY:
Then what are we going to do?

BUDDY:
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...

CINDY:
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.

BUDDY:
Let's get a hot dog.

BUDDY:
Hey, look out, a bee!

CINDY:
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!

BUDDY:
That's what your man is supposed to do.

BUDDY:
Hey, wanna' share a soda?

CINDY:
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.

BUDDY:
Yeah.  Can I borrow five bucks?

CINDY:
What should we get?

BUDDY:
I don't care. You pick.

CINDY:
Hot dogs.

CINDY:
It was you...

HANSON:
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.

CINDY:
Both of them?

HANSON:
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.

CINDY:
This can't be happening?

HANSON:
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.

CINDY:
Noooo!!!

HANSON:
Yes!!!!

JOE:
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...

MR. BROWN:
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what True Blue is about, no argument about that.

MR. BROWN:
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.

JOE:
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.

MR. WHITE:
What's that?

JOE:
I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?

MR. BROWN:
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in The Great Escape. He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.

JOE:
Chew? Toby Chew? No.

MR. BROWN:
It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be BubbleYum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, Like a Virgin.

JOE:
Wong?

MR. BROWN:
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry fuckingVale.

JOE:
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?

MR. WHITE:
Give me this fucking thing.

JOE:
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!

MR. WHITE:
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe I'll give it back when we leave.

JOE:
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.

MR. WHITE:
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan. I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap Idon'tknowwhat, outta my left.

JOE:
What do you care?

MR. WHITE:
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.

JOE:
Give me my book.

MR. WHITE:
You gonna put it away?

JOE:
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.

MR. WHITE:
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.

MR. BLONDE:
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?

MR. WHITE:
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.

NICE GUY EDDIE:
Have you guys been listening to K BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?

MR. PINK:
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?

NICE GUY EDDIE:
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?

MR. PINK:
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? HeartbeatIt's Lovebeat, by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.

NICE GUY EDDIE:
When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a milliontrillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.

JOE:
No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.

MR. WHITE:
Who gives a damn?

JOE:
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.

MR. WHITE:
Sorry, it's my book now.

JOE:
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?

NICE GUY EDDIE:
C'mon, throw in a buck.

MR. PINK:
Uhuh. I don't tip.

NICE GUY EDDIE:
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?

MR. PINK:
I don't believe in it.

NICE GUY EDDIE:
You don't believe in tipping?

NICE GUY EDDIE:
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?

MR. PINK:
I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.

NICE GUY EDDIE:
I'd go over twelve percent for that.

MR. PINK:
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.

MR. PINK:
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.

NICE GUY EDDIE:
Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard 

MR. PINK:
Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.

MR. WHITE:
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.

MR. PINK:
So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.

MR. WHITE:
Waitressing is the number one occupation for female noncollege graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.

MR. PINK:
Fuck all that.

JOE:
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?

MR. ORANGE:
Mr. Pink.

JOE:
Mr. Pink?  Why?

MR. ORANGE:
He don't tip.

JOE:
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?

MR. ORANGE:
He don't believe in it.

JOE:
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?

MR. ORANGE:
Nope.

JOE:
Shut up!  Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast.

MR. PINK:
Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.

JOE:
Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.

MR. WHITE:
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.

MR. ORANGE:
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.

MR. WHITE:
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?

MR. ORANGE:
No, I'm not!

MR. WHITE:
Saythegoddamnwords You're gonna be okay!

MR. ORANGE:
I'm okay.

MR. WHITE:
Correct.

MR. WHITE:
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?

MR. ORANGE:
Joe.

MR. WHITE:
Bet your sweet ass we are.

MR. WHITE:
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.

MR. ORANGE:
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.

MR. ORANGE:
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.

MR. WHITE:
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?

MR. ORANGE:
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.

MR. WHITE:
It's not good...

MR. ORANGE:
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.

MR. WHITE:
I can' take you to a hospital.

MR. ORANGE:
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  Iwon'ttellthemanything. You'll be safe.

MR. WHITE:
Lie back down, and try to 

MR. ORANGE:
I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.

MR. WHITE:
Gun shot.

MR. PINK:
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?

MR. WHITE:
Dead.

MR. PINK:
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?

MR. WHITE:
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.

MR. PINK:
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?

MR. WHITE:
As opposed to good?

MR. PINK:
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.

MR. WHITE:
You really think we were set up?

MR. PINK:
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?

MR. WHITE:
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.

MR. PINK:
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.

MR. WHITE:
Let's go in the other room...

MR. PINK:
What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said No thank you, and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!

MR. WHITE:
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?

MR. PINK:
I'm cool.

MR. WHITE:
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.

MR. WHITE:
Want a smoke?

MR. PINK:
Why not?

MR. WHITE:
Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the 

MR. PINK:
That's not correct.

MR. WHITE:
What's wrong with it?

MR. PINK:
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.

MR. WHITE:
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.

MR. PINK:
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?

MR. WHITE:
Look, enough of this Mr White shit 

MR. PINK:
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.

MR. WHITE:
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?

MR. PINK:
Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.

MR. PINK:
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?

MR. WHITE:
A few cops.

MR. PINK:
No real people?

MR. WHITE:
Uhuh, just cops.

MR. PINK:
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

MR. WHITE:
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?

MR. PINK:
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.

MR. WHITE:
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just triggerhappy?

MR. PINK:
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close   to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.

MR. WHITE:
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twentyone?

MR. PINK:
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?

MR. WHITE:
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.

MR. PINK:
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.

MR. WHITE:
What do you think?

MR. PINK:
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.

MR. WHITE:
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.

MR. PINK:
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?

MR. WHITE:
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a 

MR. PINK:
Nope.

MR. WHITE:
How can you be so sure?

MR. PINK:
I got the diamonds.

MR. WHITE:
Where?

MR. PINK:
I got 'em, all right?

MR. WHITE:
Where? Are they out in the car?

MR. PINK:
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.

MR. WHITE:
That was the plan, we meet here.

MR. PINK:
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.

MR. WHITE:
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.

MR. PINK:
What?

MR. WHITE:
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.

MR. PINK:
No shit?

MR. WHITE:
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.

MR. PINK:
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.

MR. WHITE:
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.

MR. PINK:
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.

MR. WHITE:
For all I know, you're the rat.

MR. PINK:
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.

MR. WHITE:
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.

MR. PINK:
Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?

MR. PINK:
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?

MR. WHITE:
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.

JOE:
What's she doin' now?

MR. WHITE:
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.

JOE:
Fiveman job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.

MR. WHITE:
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.

JOE:
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?

MR. WHITE:
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.

JOE:
What for?

MR. WHITE:
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?

JOE:
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.

MR. WHITE:
How many employees?

JOE:
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.

MR. WHITE:
No, they're not.

MR. WHITE:
What's the cut, poppa?

JOE:
Juicy, junior, real juicy.

MR. PINK:
So, is he dead or what?

MR. WHITE:
He ain't dead.

MR. PINK:
So what is it?

MR. WHITE:
I think he's just passed out.

MR. PINK:
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. I thought he was dead fer sure.

MR. WHITE:
He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.

MR. PINK:
We can't take him to a hospital.

MR. WHITE:
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.

MR. PINK:
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.

MR. WHITE:
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.

MR. PINK:
You gotta idea, spit it out.

MR. WHITE:
Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.

MR. PINK:
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.

MR. WHITE:
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.

MR. PINK:
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.

MR. WHITE:
I don't know anybody.

MR. PINK:
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.

MR. WHITE:
Well, he knows a little about me.

MR. PINK:
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?

MR. WHITE:
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.

MR. PINK:
Why!

MR. WHITE:
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.

MR. PINK:
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?

MR. WHITE:
He asked.

MR. WHITE:
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess  he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough.? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.

MR. PINK:
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful 

MR. WHITE:
Don't fuckin' patronize me.

MR. PINK:
One question Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?

MR. WHITE:
Of course.

MR. PINK:
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?

MR. WHITE:
If I have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round.

MR. PINK:
We ain't taking him to a hospital.

MR. WHITE:
If we don't, he'll die.

MR. PINK:
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.

MR. WHITE:
That fuckin did it!

MR. WHITE:
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!

MR. PINK:
Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.

MR. PINK:
He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.

MR. WHITE:
Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.

MR. BLONDE:
So, talk.

MR. WHITE:
We think we got a rat in the house.

MR. WHITE:
Is that supposed to be funny?

MR. PINK:
We don't think this place is safe.

MR. WHITE:
This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us.

MR. BLONDE:
What's this guy's problem?

MR. WHITE:
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any triggerhappy madman who almost gets me shot!

MR. BLONDE:
What're you talkin' about?

MR. WHITE:
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.

MR. BLONDE:
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.

MR. WHITE:
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.

MR. BLONDE:
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?

MR. WHITE:
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?

MR. BLONDE:
I said Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite.

MR. PINK:
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!

MR. WHITE:
So you wanna git bit, huh?

MR. PINK:
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.

MR. WHITE:
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.

MR. PINK:
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.

MR. WHITE:
You takin' his side?

MR. PINK:
Fuck sides! What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. Now I know I'm no piece of shit...  And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy...  And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who's the bad guy.

MR. WHITE:
Follow you where?

MR. BLONDE:
Down to my car.

MR. WHITE:
Why?

MR. BLONDE:
It's a surprise.

MR. WHITE:
For what, the cops?

MR. BLONDE:
Nice Guy Eddie.

MR. WHITE:
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?

MR. BLONDE:
You didn't ask.

MR. WHITE:
Hardyfuckinhar. What did he say?

MR. BLONDE:
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.

JOE:
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?

VIC:
It's a change.

JOE:
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?

VIC:
Sure.

JOE:
Take a seat.

JOE:
Who's your parole officer?

VIC:
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.

JOE:
How is he?

VIC:
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.

JOE:
Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer. But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ballbustin' prick.

VIC:
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.

JOE:
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?

VIC:
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.

JOE:
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?

VIC:
Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again.

EDDIE:
How ya doin', Toothpick?

VIC:
Fine, now.

EDDIE:
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.

VIC:
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.

EDDIE:
That I should've picked you up?

VIC:
No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up. And I say Well, Joe, I coulda told you that. I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet!   I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.

EDDIE:
Daddy, did ya see that?

JOE:
What?

EDDIE:
Guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me.

VIC:
You fuckin' wish.

EDDIE:
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot 

VIC:
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.

EDDIE:
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.

VIC:
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy Tbone hound.

EDDIE:
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.

JOE:
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.

EDDIE:
Really? Who's your P.O.?

VIC:
Seymour Scagnetti.

EDDIE:
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.

VIC:
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.

EDDIE:
You're coming back to work for us, right?

VIC:
I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honesttogoodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew.

JOE:
We can work this out, can't we?

EDDIE:
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.

VIC:
I don't wanna lift crates.

EDDIE:
You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin what the fuck. And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places  and we got places all over the place.

JOE:
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.

EDDIE:
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.

VIC:
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?

JOE:
Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda 

EDDIE:
Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.

JOE:
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.

EDDIE:
Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him.

EDDIE:
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!

MR. WHITE:
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.

MR. PINK:
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.

EDDIE:
What? Nobody set anybody up.

MR. PINK:
The cops were there waitin' for us!

EDDIE:
Bullshit.

MR. PINK:
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.

EDDIE:
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?

MR. PINK:
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?

EDDIE:
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?

MR. PINK:
I don't know, but somebody did.

EDDIE:
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.

MR. PINK:
I told ya he'd be pissed.

MR. WHITE:
What are you gonna do about him?

EDDIE:
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.

MR. WHITE:
You ain't dying, he is.

EDDIE:
I'll call somebody.

MR. WHITE:
Who?

EDDIE:
A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think. I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?

MR. PINK:
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.

EDDIE:
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?

EDDIE:
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?

MR. PINK:
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.

EDDIE:
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.

MR. PINK:
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.

EDDIE:
Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.

MR. WHITE:
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.

MR. BLONDE:
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah.

MR. WHITE:
He's the reason the place turned into a shooting gallery.  What are you, a silent partner? Fuckin' tell him.

MR. PINK:
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.

MR. WHITE:
This is what he was doin'.

MR. BLONDE:
I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.

MR. WHITE:
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?

MR. BLONDE:
I don't like alarms.

EDDIE:
What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.

MR. PINK:
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.

EDDIE:
There is no fuckin' set up!  Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.

MR. BLONDE:
Alone at last.

MR. BLONDE:
Now where were we?

COP:
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want 

MR. BLONDE:
Thanks, don't mind if I do.

COP:
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.

MR. BLONDE:
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?

MR. BLONDE:
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?

COP:
Yes.

MR. BLONDE:
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.

MARVIN:
I know.

MR. ORANGE:
You do?

MARVIN:
Your name's Freddy something.

MR. ORANGE:
Freddy Newendyke.

MARVIN:
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.

MR. ORANGE:
Shit. I don't remember that at all.

MARVIN:
I do.  How do I look?

MARVIN:
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!

MR. ORANGE:
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.

MARVIN:
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!

MR. ORANGE:
And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.

FREDDY:
Say hello to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?

HOLDAWAY:
This better not be some Freddy joke.

FREDDY:
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...

HOLDAWAY:
...What bar?

FREDDY:
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.

HOLDAWAY:
You ever seen this motherfucker before?

FREDDY:
Who, Mr. White?

HOLDAWAY:
Yeah.

FREDDY:
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.

HOLDAWAY:
How can you tell?

FREDDY:
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.

HOLDAWAY:
Did the two of you talk?

FREDDY:
Me and Mr. White?

HOLDAWAY:
Yeah.

FREDDY:
A little.

HOLDAWAY:
What about?

FREDDY:
The Brewers.

HOLDAWAY:
The Milwaukee Brewers?

FREDDY:
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.

HOLDAWAY:
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddleeyed Joe to a damnedifI know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.

HOLDAWAY:
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?

FREDDY:
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.

HOLDAWAY:
Didja use the commode story?

FREDDY:
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.

FREDDY:
What's this?

HOLDAWAY:
It's a scene. Memorize it.

FREDDY:
What?

HOLDAWAY:
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.

FREDDY:
But what is this?

HOLDAWAY:
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.

FREDDY:
What?

HOLDAWAY:
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.

FREDDY:
I gotta memorize all this shit?

HOLDAWAY:
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.

FREDDY:
I can do that.

HOLDAWAY:
The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.

FREDDY:
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.

MR. WHITE:
What for?

FREDDY:
Traffic tickets gone to warrant. They stopped him for something, found the warrants on 'im, took 'im to jail. She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed. Well, I don't wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin' me, keeps askin' me, finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it. Well, we're picking this guy up at the train station.

HOLDAWAY:
Tell me more about Cabot.

FREDDY:
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.

MR. PINK:
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.

MR. WHITE:
There's a slight difference.

MR. PINK:
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.

EDDIE:
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.

MR. WHITE:
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?

MR. PINK:
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.

MR. WHITE:
Not these guys.

MR. PINK:
Yeah, those guys too.

EDDIE:
Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.

MR. WHITE:
Elois?

EDDIE:
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.

MR. WHITE:
Where was she from, Compton?

EDDIE:
No. She was from Ladora Heights.

MR. PINK:
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills.

EDDIE:
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a maneater upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show Get Christie Love? She was a black female cop. She always used to say You're under arrest, sugar.

MR. PINK:
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?

EDDIE:
Pam Grier.

MR. PINK:
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.

MR. PINK:
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.

EDDIE:
Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight? Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit. I mean a real animal. And apparently he would so things to her.

MR. WHITE:
Jesus Christ!

FREDDY:
You can do some crazy things with it.

EDDIE:
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.

MR. WHITE:
Was he all pissed off?

JOE:
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.

MR. PINK:
Why am I Mr. Pink?

JOE:
Cause you're a faggot, alright?

MR. PINK:
Why can't we pick out our own colors?

JOE:
I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.

MR. PINK:
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.

JOE:
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.

MR. WHITE:
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...

MR. PINK:
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta coolsounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think Mr. Pink is no big deal, you wanna trade?

JOE:
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?

MR. PINK:
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.

MR. WHITE:
Let's go over it. Where are you?

FREDDY:
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.

MR. WHITE:
Mr. Brown?

FREDDY:
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.

MR. WHITE:
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?

FREDDY:
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.

MR. WHITE:
Myself and Mr. Pink?

FREDDY:
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?

MR. WHITE:
When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin' you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that sonofabitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a taco.

FREDDY:
I'm sorry.

MR. WHITE:
What? Snap out of it!

MR. WHITE:
Just hold on buddy boy.

FREDDY:
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...

MR. WHITE:
What happened?

MR. ORANGE:
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

MR. WHITE:
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.

MR. ORANGE:
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.

EDDIE:
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.

MR. WHITE:
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.

MR. PINK:
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.

EDDIE:
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?

EDDIE:
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.

JOE:
That's okay, Eddie, I do.

MR. WHITE:
What the fuck are you talking about?

JOE:
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.

JOE:
Aren't you?

MR. ORANGE:
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.

MR. WHITE:
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.

JOE:
Like hell I am.

MR. WHITE:
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're superfuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.

JOE:
You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.

MR. PINK:
Mr. Blue's dead?

JOE:
Dead as Dillinger.

EDDIE:
The motherfucker killed Vic.

MR. WHITE:
How do you know all this?

JOE:
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.

MR. WHITE:
That's your proof?

JOE:
You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.

MR. WHITE:
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.

EDDIE:
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!

JOE:
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.

MR. WHITE:
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!

JOE:
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.

MR. WHITE:
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!

JOE:
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.

MR. WHITE:
Don't ask me that.

JOE:
I'm not askin', I'm betting.

BIGGS:
Of course, where you been kid?

LUKE:
You look great!  The uniform and everything!

BIGGS:
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!

LUKE:
But there was a lot of firing earlier...

VADER:
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...

LEIA:
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!

VADER:
It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported.  There will be no one to save you this time.

BIGGS:
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...

LUKE:
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?

BIGGS:
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is downright amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force  go freelance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.

LUKE:
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.

BIGGS:
Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.

OWEN:
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.

LUKE:
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.

OWEN:
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...

LUKE:
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!

OWEN:
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.

LUKE:
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...

OWEN:
Your father's dead.  Don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long.  I don't want another word.  Finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'

LUKE:
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.

THREEPIO:
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.

LUKE:
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.

THREEPIO:
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.

LUKE:
There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...

THREEPIO:
Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...

LUKE:
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?

THREEPIO:
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...

LUKE:
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?

THREEPIO:
Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...

LUKE:
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...

THREEPIO:
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.

LUKE:
Well, I don't know what to do now. We'll just have to head inland and see if we can't find a settlement.

BEN:
Good morning!

LUKE:
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?

BEN:
All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?

BEN:
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.

LUKE:
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!

BEN:
You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.

THREEPIO:
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...

LUKE:
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.

THREEPIO:
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.

LUKE:
No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...

LUKE:
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.

BEN:
Oh, so you're a warrior then?

LUKE:
Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.

LUKE:
Who are you anyway?

BEN:
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.

LUKE:
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?

BEN:
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.

BEN:
I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.

LUKE:
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.

BEN:
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.

LUKE:
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...

LUKE:
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.

BEN:
I know that.

LUKE:
You saw through me?

BEN:
You could put it that way.

LUKE:
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.

BEN:
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?

LUKE:
My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.

BEN:
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.

LUKE:
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.

BEN:
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.

LUKE:
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!

BEN:
Not any more!

BEN:
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.

LUKE:
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...

BEN:
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.

LUKE:
You mean I generate an energy field?

BEN:
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!

LUKE:
Could I learn to feel it?

BEN:
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.

LUKE:
What do you mean?

BEN:
It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!

BEN:
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.

LUKE:
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.

BEN:
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.

LUKE:
How can you store an energy field within you?

BEN:
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.

LUKE:
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?

BEN:
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...

LUKE:
That's where my father was killed.

BEN:
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.

LUKE:
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?

BEN:
They use the Bogan Force.

LUKE:
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.

BEN:
There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.

HAN:
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?

BEN:
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.

HAN:
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.

LUKE:
That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.

LUKE:
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?

BEN:
Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.

HAN:
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.

LUKE:
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.

LUKE:
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!

THREEPIO:
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.

LUKE:
Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.

LUKE:
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?

BEN:
He's bluffing...

LUKE:
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?

BEN:
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.

LUKE:
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?

BEN:
These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...

LUKE:
What's wrong?  What's happening?

BEN:
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.

LUKE:
Are you all right?

BEN:
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.

VADER:
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.

LEIA:
They'll find its weakness.

VADER:
It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major.  It appears your data never got through.

LEIA:
No!...

VADER:
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...

LUKE:
Who's the pilot?

HAN:
It's automatic.

LUKE:
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.

THREEPIO:
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.

LUKE:
Are you sure you don't need it?

BEN:
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.

LUKE:
What do I do?

BEN:
All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.

HAN:
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.

LUKE:
You don't believe in the Force?

HAN:
Sorcery!  I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.

BEN:
Well, we'll see...

HAN:
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.

BEN:
What is it?

LUKE:
He can't find Organa Major.

HAN:
I found it... It's just not there.

LUKE:
What are you saying?

BEN:
The Empire must have gotten here first.

HAN:
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.

BEN:
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.

HAN:
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?

BEN:
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.

HAN:
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?

BEN:
No, not anymore.

HAN:
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.

LUKE:
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...

HAN:
Why?

BEN:
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.

HAN:
Who's going to pay me then?

BEN:
I think there are some things we should talk about.

HAN:
I'm beginning not to like you.

HAN:
How much do you think she's talking about?

BEN:
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...

HAN:
Anything I want!  Now that's interesting.

LUKE:
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.

HAN:
All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.

BEN:
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.

LUKE:
You mean we should go after her!...

BEN:
I didn't say that, but it appears to be a logical alternative.

HAN:
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!

LUKE:
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.

HAN:
Don't you believe it.

BEN:
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward largescale assault.

HAN:
This isn't a game, you know.

HAN:
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.

BEN:
Fear is their greatest weapon.

HAN:
I'm not afraid of anything...

BEN:
You have your father's style.  You've done very well.

HAN:
Not bad.

LUKE:
Well, I practice a lot...

HAN:
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?

LUKE:
I don't know... I've never fought anyone.

LUKE:
I can't see!  How can I fight?

BEN:
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...

LUKE:
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.

BEN:
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.

BEN:
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.

LUKE:
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.

HAN:
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?

BEN:
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...

HAN:
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.

BEN:
All right then, we'll use your plan.

HAN:
I'll get the information.

BEN:
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan shielded compartments.

HAN:
What do you want with our scanproof lockers?

CONTROLLER:
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twentyseven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.

COMMANDER:
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.

CONTROLLER:
Should we alert the Sith Lords?

COMMANDER:
I'll make a report later.

CONTROLLER:
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.

COMMANDER:
Send one squad up.

COMMANDER:
We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.

CONTROLLER:
Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.

BEN:
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.

HAN:
Is that good or bad?

BEN:
It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.

LUKE:
What about the princess?

BEN:
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.

LUKE:
I'm not going alone!

HAN:
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.

BEN:
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?

HAN:
I'm not going out there.

LUKE:
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.

HAN:
Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.

THREEPIO:
Level five, Detention block A23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...

LUKE:
Send feedback into the control sensors in that Detention block.

BEN:
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.

HAN:
We'll be back before you are, old man.

BEN:
May the Force be with you.

HAN:
This isn't going to work.

LUKE:
Why didn't you say so before.

HAN:
I think I did.

LUKE:
A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...

INTERCOM VOICE:
We'll send a squad up.

LUKE:
No need, everything's under control.

INTERCOM VOICE:
With four casualties?!

LUKE:
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.

INTERCOM VOICE:
Who is this?  What's your operating...

LUKE:
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...

HAN:
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.

LUKE:
See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are??  See Threepio...

LUKE:
I think she's going to be all right.

HAN:
Not if this tunnel deadends.

LEIA:
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?

LUKE:
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.

LUKE:
Is he afraid of the water?

HAN:
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.

HAN:
Watch it!  Move back.

LUKE:
Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.

LUKE:
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!

HAN:
Move out of the way!

LUKE:
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.

LEIA:
There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.

LUKE:
See Threepio... do you copy?

THREEPIO:
I read you sir.

LUKE:
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?

THREEPIO:
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.

LUKE:
Are you safe?

THREEPIO:
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.

LUKE:
Good.  We're right above you.  Stand by.

HAN:
Get to the ship!

LUKE:
Come back here... Where are you going?

THREEPIO:
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...

LUKE:
See Threepio!  Do you copy?

LEIA:
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.

HAN:
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!

LEIA:
It could be worse...

LUKE:
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...

THREEPIO:
Are you there, sir?  We're going...

LUKE:
Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...

LEIA:
Here come six more... grid two!

HAN:
Was this trip really necessary?

LEIA:
There are only three or four left.

HAN:
Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F888 Cargo Trawler.

LEIA:
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.

HAN:
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.

LEIA:
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.

HAN:
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?

LEIA:
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.

LEIA:
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.

HAN:
Where are you taking us now anyway?

LEIA:
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.

HAN:
I'd better go see how he's doing.

LUKE:
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?

LEIA:
He'll be well cared for.

HAN:
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.

LUKE:
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.

HAN:
Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.

HAN:
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.

LEIA:
Did it occur to you they might find us?

LEIA:
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.

HAN:
I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.

HAN:
What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.

LEIA:
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?

LEIA:
And you?

LUKE:
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.

LEIA:
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.

LUKE:
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...

HAN:
I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.

LUKE:
The Kiber Crystal.

BEN:
Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.

THREEPIO:
Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.

LUKE:
I'd consider it an honor.

BLUE LEADER:
You're Starkiller?

LUKE:
Yes, sir.

BLUE LEADER:
Have you been checked out?

LUKE:
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T2.

BLUE LEADER:
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.

LUKE:
Yes, sir.

BLUE LEADER:
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?

LUKE:
I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.

LUKE:
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.

BLUE LEADER:
What's that?

BLUE LEADER:
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?

LUKE:
Yes, sir, but I can get him...

BLUE LEADER:
Forget it, son.

HAN:
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.

LUKE:
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.

TIM:
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?

JOHN:
Gimme that Phillips right there.

JOHN:
Easy money!

TIM:
Where'd you learn all this stuff?

TIM:
So she's pretty cool, huh?

JOHN:
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.

TIM:
No shit?

JOHN:
Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7Eleven, whatya say?

REESE:
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.

SARAH:
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...

REESE:
I love you.  I always will.

SARAH:
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.

SARAH:
They took him from me.

REESE:
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.

SARAH:
I know!

REESE:
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.

SARAH:
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.

REESE:
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.

SARAH:
Kyle, don't go!

REESE:
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.

VIDEO SARAH:
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to 

VIDEO SILBERMAN:
Please continue...

VIDEO SARAH:
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!

VIDEO SILBERMAN:
I'm sure it feels very real to you 

VIDEO SARAH:
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?

VIDEO SILBERMAN:
Relax now, Sarah 

VIDEO SARAH:
You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!

SARAH:
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.

SILBERMAN:
And what it that?

SARAH:
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.

SILBERMAN:
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?

SILBERMAN:
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.

SARAH:
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.

SILBERMAN:
I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?

SARAH:
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?

SILBERMAN:
You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.

JOHN:
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?

TERMINATOR:
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

JOHN:
No way!

JOHN:
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?

TERMINATOR:
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.

JOHN:
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?

TERMINATOR:
My mission is to protect you.

JOHN:
Yeah?  Who sent you?

TERMINATOR:
You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.

JOHN:
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?

TERMINATOR:
Not like me.  A T1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.

JOHN:
What does that mean?

TERMINATOR:
Liquid metal.

JOHN:
Radical.

TERMINATOR:
You are targeted for termination.  The T1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.

JOHN:
Where we going?

TERMINATOR:
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.

JOHN:
Can I stop by my house?

TERMINATOR:
Negative.  The T1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.

JOHN:
You sure?

TERMINATOR:
I would.

TERMINATOR:
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?

JOHN:
Max.

JOHN:
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?

TERMINATOR:
Anything it samples by physical contact.

JOHN:
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?

TERMINATOR:
No.  Only an object of equal size.

JOHN:
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?

TERMINATOR:
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.

JOHN:
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy exGreen Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just madeup fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.

TERMINATOR:
Negative.  The T1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.

JOHN:
Oh, great.  And what happens to her?

TERMINATOR:
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.

JOHN:
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!

TERMINATOR:
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.

JOHN:
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!

JOHN:
Oww!  Why'd you do that?

TERMINATOR:
You told me to.

JOHN:
You have to do what I say?!

TERMINATOR:
That is one of my mission parameters.

JOHN:
Prove it... stand on one foot.

JOHN:
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!

TERMINATOR:
Of course.  I'm a terminator.

JOHN:
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!

TERMINATOR:
Why?

JOHN:
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!

TERMINATOR:
Why?

JOHN:
You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.

SILBERMAN:
You broke my arm!

SARAH:
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!

JOHN:
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

TERMINATOR:
Right.

JOHN:
Swear.

TERMINATOR:
What?

JOHN:
Just say I swear I won't kill anyone.

SARAH:
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!

SILBERMAN:
Open the goddamn door!

TERMINATOR:
Everything.

JOHN:
Cool.

SARAH:
This T1000... what happens when you shoot it?

TERMINATOR:
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.

SARAH:
Can it be destroyed?

TERMINATOR:
Unknown.

SARAH:
You look like handmade shit.

TERMINATOR:
So do you.

SARAH:
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?

TERMINATOR:
Correct.

JOHN:
Does it hurt?

TERMINATOR:
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.

JOHN:
How long do you live?  I mean, last?

TERMINATOR:
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.

TERMINATOR:
My CPU is a neuralnet processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to readonly when we are sent out alone.

SARAH:
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?

TERMINATOR:
No.

SARAH:
Out of the way, John!

JOHN:
No!  Don't kill him!

SARAH:
It, John.  Not him.  It.

JOHN:
Alright, it!  We need it!

SARAH:
We're better off by ourselves.

JOHN:
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.

SARAH:
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.

JOHN:
Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.

TERMINATOR:
Affirmative.

JOHN:
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like Affirmative or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.

JOHN:
It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say eat me... if you wanna shine them on, it's Hasta la vista, baby.

TERMINATOR:
Hasta la vista, baby?

JOHN:
Yeah, or later, dickwad.  Or if someone gets upset you say chill out.  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.

TERMINATOR:
Chill out, dickwad.

JOHN:
That's great!  See, you're getting it.

TERMINATOR:
No problemo.

JOHN:
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.

TERMINATOR:
Smile?

JOHN:
Yeah.  Smile.  You know.  People smile, right? Watch.

JOHN:
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.

TERMINATOR:
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.

JOHN:
Yeah.  Drag, huh?

SARAH:
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?

TERMINATOR:
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

SARAH:
Why him?

TERMINATOR:
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.

SARAH:
Then what?

TERMINATOR:
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.

SARAH:
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?

TERMINATOR:
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes online August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes selfaware at 214 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.

SARAH:
And Skynet fights back.

TERMINATOR:
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.

SARAH:
Why attack Russia?

TERMINATOR:
Because Skynet knows the Russian counterstrike will remove its enemies here.

SARAH:
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?

TERMINATOR:
I have detailed files.

SARAH:
I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.

TARISSA:
You going to work all day?

DYSON:
I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...

DYSON:
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...

TARISSA:
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.

DYSON:
I can't

TARISSA:
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.

DYSON:
Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.

DYSON:
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neuralnet process 

TARISSA:
I know.  You told me.  It's a neuralnet processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.

DYSON:
I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close.

DYSON:
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.

TARISSA:
Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.

TERMINATOR:
Excellent.

JOHN:
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.

JOHN:
Not even of dying?

TERMINATOR:
No.

JOHN:
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?

TERMINATOR:
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.

TERMINATOR:
Torque wrench please.

JOHN:
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.

TERMINATOR:
You will.

JOHN:
Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.

TERMINATOR:
Why do you cry?

JOHN:
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.

TERMINATOR:
Pain causes it?

JOHN:
Uhunh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?

TERMINATOR:
No.

JOHN:
Alriight!!  My man!

TERMINATOR:
No problemo.

JOHN:
No fate.  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her  Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.

TERMINATOR:
She intends to change the future somehow.

JOHN:
I guess, yeah   Oh shit!!

TERMINATOR:
Dyson.

JOHN:
Yeah, gotta be!  Miles Dyson!  She's gonna blow him away!

TERMINATOR:
This is tactically dangerous.

JOHN:
Drive faster.

TERMINATOR:
The T1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.

JOHN:
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.

TERMINATOR:
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.

JOHN:
I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?

DYSON:
Please... let... the kids... go...

SARAH:
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!

JOHN:
Mom?  You okay?

SARAH:
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?

JOHN:
Uh huh.

JOHN:
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.

SARAH:
I love you, John.  I always have.

JOHN:
I know, Mom.  I know.

TERMINATOR:
Do you have bandages?

DYSON:
In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?

DYSON:
My God.

TERMINATOR:
Now listen to me very carefully.

SARAH:
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.

JOHN:
Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a genderrelated issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?

TARISSA:
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?

DYSON:
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,

DYSON:
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?

TERMINATOR:
No one must follow your work.

DYSON:
Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care.

DYSON:
Do you know about the chip?

SARAH:
What chip?

DYSON:
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.

TERMINATOR:
The CPU from the first terminator.

SARAH:
Son of a bitch, I knew it!

DYSON:
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.

SARAH:
Those lying motherfuckers!

DYSON:
I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.

TERMINATOR:
I must be destroyed.

SARAH:
Can you get us in there, past security?

SARAH:
Is it safe for them here?

TERMINATOR:
Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack.  Let's go.

DYSON:
We should abort.

SARAH:
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?

DYSON:
No good.

TERMINATOR:
Let me try mine.

JOHN:
I got it.  Piece of cake.

SARAH:
Go!  I'll finish here.

TERMINATOR:
I'll deal with the police.

JOHN:
Remember what I said, you can't...

TERMINATOR:
Trust me.

JOHN:
Ready to rock?

SARAH:
Ready.

TERMINATOR:
Drive for a minute.

JOHN:
Where you going?!

TERMINATOR:
We don't have much time.

JOHN:
What?

SARAH:
John, get out of the way!!

JOHN:
SHOOT!!!!

JOHN:
Is it dead?

TERMINATOR:
Terminated.

JOHN:
Will it melt in there?

TERMINATOR:
Yes.  Throw it in.

SARAH:
It's finally over.

TERMINATOR:
No.  There is another chip.

JOHN:
No!

TERMINATOR:
I'm sorry, John.

JOHN:
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!

TERMINATOR:
I have to go away, John.

JOHN:
Don't do it.  Please... don't go 

TERMINATOR:
It must end here... or I am the future.

JOHN:
I order you not to!

SARAH:
Are you afraid?

TERMINATOR:
Yes.

SARAH:
Yes, Chuck?

BREEN:
Come to the office, please.

SARAH:
Mission control to Chuck, come in...

BREEN:
You're late.

SARAH:
Aren't I worth waiting for?

BREEN:
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?

SARAH:
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.

BREEN:
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.

SARAH:
Thanks, Chuck.  I need the money.  Can I still work the hours around my classes?

BREEN:
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.

SARAH:
Alright!

BREEN:
Can you handle it?

SARAH:
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.

BREEN:
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.

SARAH:
I won't let the fat kid down.

CLERK:
Anything else?

TERMINATOR:
A phased plasma pulselaser in the forty watt range...

CLERK:
Just what you see, pal.

TERMINATOR:
The Uzi 9 millimeter.

CLERK:
You know your weapons, buddy.

CLERK:
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?

TERMINATOR:
All.

CLERK:
You can't to that...

TERMINATOR:
Wrong.

SARAH:
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.

MR. MILLER:
What's it to ya?

SARAH:
You must have a girlfriend.

MR. MILLER:
That's none of your business.

SARAH:
Aha!  Is she young?

MR. MILLER:
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal ing?

SARAH:
What's it to ya?

SARAH:
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.

GINGER:
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.

SARAH:
I'll do the same for you sometime.

SARAH:
What do you think?

GINGER:
Great.

GINGER:
Great.

SARAH:
You're a big help.

GINGER:
Alright, the beige one.

SARAH:
I hate the beige one.

GINGER:
Don't wear the beige one.

VUKOVICH:
Give me the short version.

TRAXLER:
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber

TRAXLER:
Okay, let's see...Got a pos itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal

VUKOVICH:
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after noon.

TRAXLER:
Here's her driver's license.

VUKOVICH:
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be shortstroking it over this one.  A oneday pattern killer.

TRAXLER:
I hate the weird ones.

GINGER:
Not lately.  Did you check messages?

SARAH:
I thought you did.

GINGER:
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.

m549:
SARAH 

SARAH:
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.

GINGER:
We will, kiddo.

TRAXLER:
That stuff's two hours cold.

VUKOVICH:
I know.

TRAXLER:
I put a cigarette out in it.

VUKOVICH:
Did you reach the next girl yet?

TRAXLER:
No.  Keep getting an answer ing machine.

VUKOVICH:
Send a unit.

TRAXLER:
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.

VUKOVICH:
Call her.

TRAXLER:
I just called.

VUKOVICH:
Call her again.

TRAXLER:
Same shit.

VUKOVICH:
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.

TRAXLER:
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?

VUKOVICH:
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.

VUKOVICH:
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?

TRAXLER:
Like shit, boss.

SARAH:
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...

VUKOVICH:
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?

SARAH:
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.

VUKOVICH:
Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.

VUKOVICH:
Go!  Go!  He's got her.

TRAXLER:
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...

REESE:
Do you understand?

SARAH:
Yes.  Don't hurt me.

REESE:
I'm here to help you.  Reese, SergeantTechCom, DN38416...

SARAH:
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.

REESE:
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.

REESE:
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.

SARAH:
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...

REESE:
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.

SARAH:
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.

REESE:
No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years.

SARAH:
So, it's from the future, is that right?

REESE:
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.

SARAH:
And you're from the future too?

REESE:
Right.

SARAH:
Just let me go.

REESE:
Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.

REESE:
There's so much...

SARAH:
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.

REESE:
everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.

SARAH:
I don't understand...

REESE:
Defense network computer. New. Powerful.  Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all.  They say it got smart...a new order of intelli gence.  Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side.  Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.

REESE:
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the HK's.

SARAH:
The what?

REESE:
Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.

VUKOVICH:
Here, drink some of this...

SARAH:
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.

VUKOVICH:
They've already been identi fied.  There's no doubt.

VUKOVICH:
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?

SARAH:
I guess so.  You're a doctor?

SILBERMAN:
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?

REESE:
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27

SILBERMAN:
The year 2027?

SILBERMAN:
And who was the enemy?

REESE:
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SACNORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.

SILBERMAN:
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?

REESE:
Yes.

TRAXLER:
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on

VUKOVICH:
Shut up.

REESE:
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what ever it was called...the timedisplacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.

SILBERMAN:
Then how are you supposed to get back?

REESE:
Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.

REESE:
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.

SILBERMAN:
Why?

REESE:
I didn't build the fucking thing.

SILBERMAN:
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...

REESE:
Surrounded by living tissue.

SILBERMAN:
Of course.

SILBERMAN:
Why were the other two women killed?

REESE:
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.

REESE:
You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?

SILBERMAN:
I'm afraid that's not up to me.

REESE:
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.

SILBERMAN:
I can help you...

REESE:
Who is in authority here?

VUKOVICH:
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.

SARAH:
I can't sleep.

VUKOVICH:
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.

SARAH:
Okay.

REESE:
You cold?

SARAH:
Freezing.

REESE:
Come here.

SARAH:
Reese...you got a first name?

REESE:
Kyle.

SARAH:
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?

REESE:
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.

REESE:
I caught one, back there.

SARAH:
Caught one?  You mean you got shot?

SARAH:
We gotta get you to a doctor.

REESE:
It's okay.  Forget it.

SARAH:
Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.

SARAH:
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.

REESE:
What?

SARAH:
Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall?

SARAH:
What's he like?

REESE:
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.

SARAH:
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.

REESE:
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...

SARAH:
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?

REESE:
I volunteered.

SARAH:
You volunteered?

REESE:
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.

REESE:
I'm sure.

SARAH:
Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.

REESE:
Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.

SARAH:
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?

REESE:
You'll learn.

SARAH:
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.

REESE:
John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you.  For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  You must survive, or I will never exist.'  That's all.

REESE:
Good fielddressing.

SARAH:
You like it?  It's my first.

REESE:
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.

SARAH:
Okay.  Talk some more.

REESE:
About what?

SARAH:
About where you're from.

REESE:
Bag some Z's?

SARAH:
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.

SARAH:
Thanks a lot.

REESE:
What's that?

SARAH:
That's where we're going.

REESE:
Why?

SARAH:
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?

REESE:
What about it?

SARAH:
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...

REESE:
Molecularmemory.

SARAH:
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?

REESE:
That's the way it was told to me.

SARAH:
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eightysix it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.

REESE:
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.

SARAH:
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.

REESE:
That's not my mission.

SARAH:
Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.

REESE:
Let's go.  Time to move out.

SARAH:
Fuck you!  Let go of me!

SARAH:
Kyle?

REESE:
I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...

REESE:
Is this enough?

SARAH:
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.

SARAH:
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.

REESE:
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.

SARAH:
What's that?

REESE:
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.

REESE:
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the endcap on...very gently.

SARAH:
You must have had a fun child

REESE:
That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.

SARAH:
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and footlong hot dogs...

REESE:
Hot dogs?

SARAH:
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.

REESE:
My whole life has been combat.

SARAH:
I want it to be over for you.

REESE:
Not possible.

SARAH:
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.

SARAH:
He'll find us, won't he?

REESE:
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...

SARAH:
Don't say that.

REESE:
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.

SARAH:
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.

REESE:
No.  I'm not.

SARAH:
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?

REESE:
Good fighters.

SARAH:
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?

REESE:
Someone?

SARAH:
A girl.  You know.

REESE:
No.  Never.

SARAH:
So much pain.

REESE:
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.

SARAH:
And so you feel nothing.

REESE:
It's better that way.

SARAH:
Oh, Kyle.

REESE:
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...

SARAH:
Kyle...

SARAH:
I bet you're ticklish.

REESE:
Ticklish?

REESE:
What are you doing?

SARAH:
You'll beg for mercy in a second.

REESE:
I don't think I like this.

SARAH:
You're not supposed to.

REESE:
Sarah.

SARAH:
We did it, Kyle.  We got it.

SARAH:
What are you doing?

REESE:
Cover...our footsteps...

JERJERROD:
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.

VADER:
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.

JERJERROD:
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.

VADER:
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.

JERJERROD:
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.

VADER:
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.

JERJERROD:
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.

VADER:
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.

VADER:
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.

JERJERROD:
We shall double our efforts.

VADER:
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.

NINEDENINE:
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?

THREEPIO:
I am SeeThreepio, humancy...

NINEDENINE:
Yes or no will do.

THREEPIO:
Oh. Well, yes.

NINEDENINE:
How many languages do you speak?

THREEPIO:
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...

NINEDENINE:
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.

THREEPIO:
Disintegrated?

BOUSHH:
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.

HAN:
I can't see.

BOUSHH:
Your eyesight will return in time.

HAN:
Where am I?

BOUSHH:
Jabba's palace.

HAN:
Who are you?

LEIA:
Someone who loves you.

HAN:
Leia!

LEIA:
I gotta get you out of here.

LEIA:
Ugh!

THREEPIO:
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.

LUKE:
Han!

HAN:
Luke!

LUKE:
Are you all right?

HAN:
Fine. Together again, huh?

LUKE:
Wouldn't miss it.

HAN:
How are we doing?

LUKE:
The same as always.

HAN:
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?

THREEPIO:
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.

HAN:
Good, I hate long waits.

THREEPIO:
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the allpowerful Sarlacc.

THREEPIO:
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.

HAN:
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?

HAN:
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.

LUKE:
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.

HAN:
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.

LUKE:
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.

HAN:
Oh... great!

LANDO:
Han! Chewie?

HAN:
Lando!

HAN:
Lando, grab it!

LANDO:
Lower it!

HAN:
I'm trying!

HAN:
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.

LANDO:
No, wait! I thought you were blind!

HAN:
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.

LANDO:
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!

HAN:
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!

LEIA:
That's all any of us can see.

HAN:
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?

LUKE:
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.

HAN:
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.

LANDO:
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.

VADER:
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.

EMPEROR:
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.

VADER:
Yes, my Master.

EMPEROR:
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.

VADER:
As you wish.

EMPEROR:
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.

LUKE:
Master Yoda, you can't die.

YODA:
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.

LUKE:
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.

YODA:
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.

LUKE:
Yoda, I must know.

YODA:
Your father he is.

YODA:
Told you, did he?

LUKE:
Yes.

YODA:
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...

LUKE:
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

LUKE:
Well, I'm sorry.

YODA:
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.

LUKE:
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.

BEN:
Yoda will always be with you.

LUKE:
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.

BEN:
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.

LUKE:
There's still good in him.

BEN:
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.

LUKE:
I can't do it, Ben.

BEN:
You cannot escape your destiny.

LUKE:
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.

BEN:
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.

LUKE:
But I had to help my friends.

BEN:
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side  the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door  for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!

LUKE:
I can't kill my own father.

BEN:
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.

LUKE:
Yoda spoke of another.

BEN:
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.

LUKE:
But I have no sister.

BEN:
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.

LUKE:
Leia! Leia's my sister.

BEN:
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.

LUKE:
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.

BEN:
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!

HAN:
Well, look at you, a general, huh?

LANDO:
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.

HAN:
Luke.

LUKE:
Hi, Han... Chewie.

HAN:
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.

LANDO:
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. Sheshe won't get a scratch. All right?

LANDO:
Good luck.

HAN:
You, too.

HAN:
You got her warmed?

LUKE:
Yeah, she's comin' up.

LEIA:
Hey, are you awake?

HAN:
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.

HAN:
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?

LUKE:
All set.

THREEPIO:
Here we go again.

HAN:
All right, hang on.

VADER:
What is thy bidding, my Master?

EMPEROR:
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.

VADER:
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?

EMPEROR:
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.

VADER:
Yes, my Master.

LEIA:
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.

HAN:
It'll work. It'll work.

LUKE:
Vader's on that ship.

HAN:
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.

HAN:
I don't know.  Fly casual.

LUKE:
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.

HAN:
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.

LEIA:
Shall we try and go around?

HAN:
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.

HAN:
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.

LUKE:
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.

LEIA:
Over there! Two more of them!

LUKE:
I see them. Wait, Leia!

HAN:
I thought she was with you.

LUKE:
We got separated.

HAN:
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.

LUKE:
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.

EMPEROR:
I told you to remain on the command ship.

VADER:
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.

VADER:
I have felt him, my Master.

EMPEROR:
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.

VADER:
They are clear, my Master.

EMPEROR:
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.

HAN:
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.

LUKE:
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?

HAN:
Yeah, sure.

HAN:
Hey!

LUKE:
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

HAN:
What are you telling them?

THREEPIO:
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

HAN:
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?

THREEPIO:
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.

HAN:
Proper?!

THREEPIO:
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.

HAN:
What did he say?

THREEPIO:
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.

LEIA:
Oh!

THREEPIO:
Your Royal Highness.

HAN:
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.

LUKE:
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.

HAN:
What's going on?

LEIA:
I don't know.

LUKE:
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?

LEIA:
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.

LUKE:
What do you remember?

LEIA:
Just...images, really. Feelings.

LUKE:
Tell me.

LEIA:
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?

LUKE:
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.

LEIA:
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?

LUKE:
Vader is here...now, on this moon.

LUKE:
He's my father.

LEIA:
Your father?

LUKE:
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.

LEIA:
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power II don't understand and could never have.

LUKE:
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.

LUKE:
Yes. It's you Leia.

LEIA:
I know. Somehow...I've always known.

LUKE:
Then you know why I have to face him.

LEIA:
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.

LUKE:
No, you don't. You've always been strong.

LEIA:
But, why must you confront him?

LUKE:
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.

LEIA:
I...

HAN:
Ahhh...

HAN:
I'm sorry.

LEIA:
Hold me.

VADER:
The Emperor has been expecting you.

LUKE:
I know, father.

VADER:
So, you have accepted the truth.

LUKE:
Come with me.

VADER:
ObiWan once thought as you do.

VADER:
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.

LUKE:
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.

VADER:
If that is your destiny.

LUKE:
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.

VADER:
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.

LEIA:
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.

HAN:
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.

LEIA:
What's he saying?

THREEPIO:
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.

LANDO:
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.

ACKBAR:
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.

ACKBAR:
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.

LANDO:
All right. Stand by.

THREEPIO:
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!

LEIA:
Quiet.

THREEPIO:
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.

LEIA:
Oh, no.

EMPEROR:
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.

VADER:
His lightsaber.

LEIA:
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.

HAN:
Charges!  Come on, come on!

LANDO:
All wings report in.

WEDGE:
Red Leader standing by.

LEIA:
The code's changed. We need Artoo!

HAN:
Here's the terminal.

ACKBAR:
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.

LANDO:
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.

ACKBAR:
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.

LANDO:
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.

THREEPIO:
We're coming!

HAN:
Come on! Come on!

THREEPIO:
Oh, Artoo, hurry!

THREEPIO:
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?

HAN:
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.

ACKBAR:
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.

LANDO:
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.

THREEPIO:
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?

HAN:
Let's see.

VADER:
ObiWan has taught you well.

LUKE:
I will not fight you, father.

LUKE:
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.

VADER:
There is no conflict.

LUKE:
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.

VADER:
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.

WEDGE:
Good shot, Red Two.

LANDO:
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.

VADER:
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

LUKE:
I will not fight you.

VADER:
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...

VADER:
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. ObiWan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.

LUKE:
Neverrr!

ACKBAR:
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.

LANDO:
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!

WEDGE:
I'm going in.

LANDO:
Here goes nothing.

LANDO:
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.

WEDGE:
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.

WEDGE:
There it is!

LANDO:
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.

WEDGE:
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.

HAN:
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.

LEIA:
He wasn't. I can feel it.

HAN:
You love him, don't you?

LEIA:
Yes.

HAN:
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.

GONZO:
One toke over the line, sweet Jesus.

DUKE:
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.

GONZO:
We're your friends. We're not like the others.

DUKE:
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.

DUKE:
If so  well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...

DUKE:
Jesus! Did I say that?

DUKE:
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?

GONZO:
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.

DUKE:
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?

HITCHHIKER:
Hell, no!

DUKE:
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?

HITCHHIKER:
What?

DUKE:
Never mind. Let's get right to the heart of this thing. Twentyfour hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel...

GONZO:
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you  and we'll have to arm ourselves.

DUKE:
Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.

DUKE:
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.

GONZO:
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?

GONZO:
O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?

DUKE:
Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voiceactivated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.

GONZO:
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.

DUKE:
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.

DUKE:
...and we're chock full of that!

GONZO:
Damn right!

DUKE:
My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?!

DUKE:
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.

GONZO:
My heart!

GONZO:
Where's the medicine?

DUKE:
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.

GONZO:
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?

DUKE:
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!

GONZO:
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!

DUKE:
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine.

GONZO:
The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've known him for years but he ripped us off  and you know what that means, right?

GONZO:
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!

DUKE:
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?

HITCHHIKER:
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.

DUKE:
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!

GONZO:
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?

DUKE:
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!

GONZO:
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.

DUKE:
You whore!

DUKE:
How long do I have?

GONZO:
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.

DUKE:
Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close.

GONZO:
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?

DUKE:
Lacerda?

DUKE:
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!

GONZO:
If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.

GONZO:
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!

DUKE:
But what about our room? And the golf shoes?

GONZO:
That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room.

DUKE:
No, no. Don't leave me!

GONZO:
Shoot it.

DUKE:
Not yet. I want to study its habits.

DUKE:
What are you talking about?

GONZO:
You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around  yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...

DUKE:
That's good...

GONZO:
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.

DUKE:
They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.

DUKE:
Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!

GONZO:
How about Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade? Hot Slots, that sounds heavy. Twenty nine cent hotdogs...

DUKE:
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?

GONZO:
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!

DUKE:
Why?

GONZO:
Why what?

DUKE:
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.

GONZO:
What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.

GONZO:
Jesus creeping shit!

DUKE:
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!

GONZO:
We wandered into a fucking time capsule!

DUKE:
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.

GONZO:
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.

DUKE:
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.

DUKE:
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks I was born... Born?

GONZO:
Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep.

GONZO:
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.

DUKE:
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.

GONZO:
That's what gives me The Fear.

DUKE:
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.

GONZO:
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?

DUKE:
Not much. Why?

GONZO:
I have to go.

DUKE:
GO?

GONZO:
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.

DUKE:
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.

GONZO:
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!

DUKE:
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.

GONZO:
Can we make it?

DUKE:
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.

GONZO:
I want to leave fast.

DUKE:
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk.

GONZO:
Do they pay you to screw that bear?

GONZO:
When does this thing stop?

DUKE:
It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.

GONZO:
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.

DUKE:
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.

GONZO:
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?

DUKE:
Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.

DUKE:
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.

GONZO:
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.

GONZO:
Yeah... I thought we might need it...

DUKE:
What for?

GONZO:
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.

DUKE:
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.

GONZO:
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.

DUKE:
He told me he was turning in early...

GONZO:
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!

DUKE:
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?

GONZO:
That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!

DUKE:
Where'd you get that knife?

GONZO:
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.

DUKE:
What limes?

GONZO:
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.

GONZO:
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?

DUKE:
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.

DUKE:
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.

GONZO:
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.

DUKE:
What tape?

GONZO:
Jefferson Airplane. White Rabbit. I want a rising sound.

DUKE:
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.

GONZO:
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.

DUKE:
OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask  just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day.

GONZO:
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates 45 an hour  but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those 100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?

DUKE:
How about a check?

GONZO:
Whatever's right.

GONZO:
I want that fucking radio!

DUKE:
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!

GONZO:
Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it roll! Just as high as the fucker can go! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!

DUKE:
Not me. It would blast you through the wall  stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!

GONZO:
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.

DUKE:
Jesus.

GONZO:
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!

GONZO:
Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.

DUKE:
Are you ready?

GONZO:
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?

DUKE:
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...

GONZO:
You cheap honky sonofabitch...

DUKE:
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!

GONZO:
The cops?

DUKE:
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!

GONZO:
Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing serious.

CLERK:
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?

DUKE:
Yes... It makes sense.

CLERK:
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.

DUKE:
He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.

CLERK:
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.

DUKE:
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes  especially with Dr. Gonzo.

CLERK:
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?

DUKE:
Awake? What do you mean?

CLERK:
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.

DUKE:
Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.

CLERK:
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?

DUKE:
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.

CLERK:
There's no hurry! The race is over!

DUKE:
Not for me.

CLERK:
Let's have lunch!

DUKE:
Righto!

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN:
May I see your license.

DUKE:
Of course, officer.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN:
Could I have that, please?

DUKE:
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN:
You realize...

DUKE:
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN:
That's a strange attitude.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN:
You know  I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?

DUKE:
A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long  three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN:
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?

DUKE:
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN:
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?

DUKE:
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.

DUKE:
You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!

GONZO:
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?

DUKE:
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!

GONZO:
You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.

DUKE:
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...

CLERK:
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead  I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good crosssection of meantempered rulecrazy cops and now it's MY turn. Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you.

CLERK:
Certainly, Mr. Duke!

DUKE:
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?

DUKE:
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?

CLERK:
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.

DUKE:
Well, thank you.

DUKE:
You degenerate pig!

GONZO:
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know  like Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.

DUKE:
WELL? What are your plans?

GONZO:
Plans?

DUKE:
Lucy.

GONZO:
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.

DUKE:
Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.

GONZO:
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.

DUKE:
She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong she'll hold her own.

GONZO:
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.

DUKE:
It's straight economics. This girl is a godsend. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.

GONZO:
NO! Stop talking like that.

DUKE:
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.

GONZO:
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.

DUKE:
In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesusbased rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.

GONZO:
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!

DUKE:
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.

DUKE:
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect My attorney.

GONZO:
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.

DUKE:
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?

GONZO:
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.

DUKE:
Us?

GONZO:
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...

DUKE:
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.

GONZO:
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.

DUKE:
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.

GONZO:
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.

DUKE:
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.

GONZO:
Right. Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon...

GONZO:
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!

DUKE:
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.

GONZO:
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!

DUKE:
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.

GONZO:
This is a fucking nightmare.

DUKE:
Right. Sure as hell some dopedealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.

DA:
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...

GONZO:
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.

DA:
Naw!

GONZO:
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.

DA:
Not down in my parts.

DUKE:
Rum and ice, please.

DA:
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.

DUKE:
They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.

DA:
Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!

GONZO:
Read the newspapers.

DUKE:
Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!

DA:
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!

DUKE:
Not where we operate.

GONZO:
Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.

DUKE:
Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!

DA:
What happened? What did they do to her?

GONZO:
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!

DA:
And nobody did anything?

DUKE:
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about sixseven, and maybe threehundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M16s.

GONZO:
They just ran back out into Death Valley  you know, where Manson turned up...

DUKE:
Like big lizards.

GONZO:
...and every one of them stacked naked...

DA:
Naked!?

DUKE:
Naked.

GONZO:
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.

DUKE:
They were all veterans.

GONZO:
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.

DA:
A major!

GONZO:
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.

DA:
Naw! Not a major.

GONZO:
He wanted the pineal gland.

DA:
Really?

GONZO:
That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.

DUKE:
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.

GONZO:
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.

DA:
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.

GONZO:
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns  go to the mat with this scum.

DA:
What do you mean by that?

GONZO:
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!

DUKE:
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.

DA:
WHAT?

GONZO:
Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.

DUKE:
We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.

DA:
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.

DUKE:
Dobermans don't talk.

DA:
What?

GONZO:
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.

DUKE:
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.

DUKE:
What's the message? My light is blinking.

CLERK:
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600.

DUKE:
Holy shit!

CLERK:
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...

DUKE:
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!

CLERK:
Killed?

DUKE:
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!

CLERK:
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?

DUKE:
Tell me. What do you want?

CLERK:
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...

DUKE:
Crying? Why was she crying?

CLERK:
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...

DUKE:
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.

CLERK:
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...

DUKE:
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.

CLERK:
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?

DUKE:
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.

GONZO:
Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.

DUKE:
Lucy is looking for you.

GONZO:
No, she's looking for you.

DUKE:
Me?

GONZO:
She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown  that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself.  I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it?

GONZO:
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.

DUKE:
It's gone too far.

GONZO:
Relax. Let me handle this.  You'd make a pisspoor lawyer... Room 1600, please.  As your attorney, I advise you not to worry.  Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.

DUKE:
What is this?

GONZO:
You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like gingerbeer. Adrenochrome.

DUKE:
Adrenochrome...

GONZO:
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...

DUKE:
I remember thinking, Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid.

DUKE:
I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped  that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.

DUKE:
Where'd you get this?

GONZO:
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.

DUKE:
Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff  the adrenaline gland from a living human body!

GONZO:
I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood  said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life.  I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome  or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on.

DUKE:
I could already feel the stuff working on me  the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine  maybe I should take a swim, I thought...

DUKE:
Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.

GONZO:
Some of what?

DUKE:
Extract of pineal!

GONZO:
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.

GONZO:
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...

DUKE:
Right!

GONZO:
...grow claws... bleeding warts.

DUKE:
Yes!

GONZO:
...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...

GONZO:
Man I'll try about anything but I'd never touch a pineal gland.

DUKE:
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?

MAID:
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...

DUKE:
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!

DUKE:
What made you do it? Who paid you off?

MAID:
Nobody. I'm the maid!

GONZO:
You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this  the manager?

MAID:
I don't know what you're talking about!

GONZO:
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!

MAID:
Part of what?

DUKE:
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?

MAID:
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!

GONZO:
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.

MAID:
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!

DUKE:
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.

MAID:
No! I swear I'm not!

GONZO:
In that case, maybe she can help.

MAID:
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!

DUKE:
So do we, lady.

GONZO:
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.

DUKE:
Do you think you can handle it?

MAID:
What?

GONZO:
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.

MAID:
You'd pay me for that?

DUKE:
You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody  you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?

MAID:
Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.

GONZO:
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.

DUKE:
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.

MAID:
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!

GONZO:
You and a lot of other people.

DUKE:
The password is One Hand Washes The Other. The minute you hear that, you say I fear nothing.

MAID:
I fear nothing.

GONZO:
Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?

MAID:
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...

GONZO:
Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people.

GONZO:
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.

DUKE:
Yeh... This foreign made crap  is sucking our dollar balance dry!

DUKE:
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...

GONZO:
Two glasses of ice water with ice.

DUKE:
I was stupid with shock  not knowing whether to run or start laughing.

GONZO:
How much is the lemon meringue pie?

DUKE:
Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level.

GONZO:
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!

DUKE:
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by  burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.

GONZO:
The airport is over there!

DUKE:
Never missed a plane yet.

GONZO:
No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!

DUKE:
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?

GONZO:
Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!

DUKE:
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.

GONZO:
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...

PROPRIETOR:
Where ya comin' from, young man?

DUKE:
Las Vegas.

PROPRIETOR:
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.

DUKE:
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.

PROPRIETOR:
That's a fine combination. You can't lose.

DUKE:
Oh, my God!...

PROPRIETOR:
This is my granddaughter...

DUKE:
Don't worry...  ...and I'm actually the District Attorney from Ignoto County.  Just another good American like yourself.

BILLY:
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.

TOMMY:
Billy, how are you?

BILLY:
Son of a bitch. Get over here.

TOMMY:
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.

BILLY:
Listen to him.  Watch the suit, he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.

TOMMY:
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?

BILLY:
Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.

BILLY:
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.

TOMMY:
No more shines, Billy.

BILLY:
Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only kidding. You can't take a joke? Come ooonn.

HENRY:
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.

TOMMY:
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.

HENRY:
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.

TOMMY:
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.

HENRY:
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.

TOMMY:
Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.

HENRY:
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.

JIMMY:
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.

HENRY:
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.

TOMMY:
There's a shovel at my mother's.

TODDY:
What happened to you?

HENRY:
I can't make any more deliveries.

TODDY:
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?

HENRY:
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.

HENRY:
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.

TODDY:
You're some fucking jerk.

TODDY:
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. 

HENRY:
I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.

JIMMY:
Keep 'em coming.

HENRY:
Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.

VARIO:
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?

SONNY:
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.

VARIO:
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.

SONNY:
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.

VARIO:
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.

SONNY:
But, Paulie, please.

VARIO:
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.

SONNY:
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.

VARIO:
What can I do? If I could do something, don't you think I would?

HENRY:
Tell him. It's okay.

VARIO:
What?

VARIO:
You want a partner?

SONNY:
Please?

TOMMY:
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.

HENRY:
Will you get the fuck out of here.

TOMMY:
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?

HENRY:
Tommy  ...

HENRY:
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a backup guy.

KAREN:
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.

HENRY:
I couldn't wait to get away. I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check.

HENRY:
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.

KAREN:
Liar!

HENRY:
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.

HENRY:
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.

KAREN:
Talk? To you? After what you did!

HENRY:
I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?

KAREN:
What're you doing? What about the car?

HENRY:
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.

KAREN:
What do you do?

HENRY:
I'm in construction.

KAREN:
They don't feel like you're in construction.

MARTY:
I didn't agree to three points over the vig. What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.

HENRY:
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.

JIMMY:
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?

HENRY:
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.

HENRY:
Go inside. I'll be right there.

KAREN:
What are you gonna do?

HENRY:
Get inside!

KAREN:
My bag. My bag.

HENRY:
What bag?

KAREN:
The bag with the envelopes.

HENRY:
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.

KAREN'S MOTHER:
He didn't call?

KAREN:
He's with his friends.

KAREN'S MOTHER:
What kind of person doesn't call?

KAREN:
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.

KAREN'S MOTHER:
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.

KAREN:
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.

KAREN'S MOTHER:
Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.

KAREN'S MOTHER:
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?

KAREN:
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.

KAREN'S MOTHER:
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?

KAREN:
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?

KAREN'S MOTHER:
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.

KAREN:
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.

ANGIE:
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.

MICKEY:
Look at Jeannie's kid.

ANGIE:
What? What happened?

MICKEY:
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy tendollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

ANGIE:
But he was always a bad kid, that one.

MICKEY:
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.

KAREN:
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband 

HENRY:
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.

KAREN:
I'm gonna need some money.

HENRY:
How much?

VARIO:
What did you hear about that thing?

HENRY:
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?

VARIO:
No. No. The guy from downtown.

HENRY:
The guy from near where Christie used to live?

VARIO:
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.

HENRY:
Oh I Him.

JIMMY:
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?

HENRY:
Paulie was just talking about him.

JIMMY:
Well, we gotta dig him up again.

HENRY:
What?

JIMMY:
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.

HENRY:
It's been six months.

JIMMY:
It's still better than letting somebody find him.

HENRY:
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.

JIMMY:
Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.

HENRY:
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!

TOMMY:
No, no. It's okay.

HENRY:
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.

TOMMY:
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.

KAREN:
I don't care. Something's going on.

HENRY:
That again.

KAREN:
Henry.  Wake up.

HENRY:
What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.

HENRY:
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.

KAREN:
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?

HENRY:
Son of a bitch.

JIMMY:
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.

HENRY:
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.

JIMMY:
We only have to shove'em over the moat.

KAREN:
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?

HENRY:
I'm just having my last few drinks.

KAREN:
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.

HENRY:
Shit.

KAREN:
You son of a bitch. She's been here.

HENRY:
What are you talking about?

KAREN:
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.

HENRY:
Jezuz Christ!

KAREN:
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.

HENRY:
What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.

HENRY:
Stop! Stop!

KAREN:
Let her carry this shit inside.

KAREN:
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?

HENRY:
It'll be okay.

KAREN:
He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.

HENRY:
We've got to help each other.

KAREN:
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.

HENRY:
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

KAREN:
I can't do it anymore.

HENRY:
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.

KAREN:
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.

HENRY:
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.

KAREN:
I don't want to hear about her anymore.

HENRY:
Never.

HENRY:
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.

KAREN:
With what?

HENRY:
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.

KAREN:
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.

HENRY:
Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie.

VARIO:
I don't want any more of that Shit.

HENRY:
Wha?  Me?

VARIO:
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.

HENRY:
Me? Why would I get into that shit?

VARIO:
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.

HENRY:
Why would I get into that?

VARIO:
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?

HENRY:
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.

VARIO:
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?

HENRY:
Nods.

VARIO:
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.

HENRY:
Nods again.

VARIO:
Anybody!  You understand?

HENRY:
I understand.

MARTY:
It's a fait accompli?

HENRY:
Done.

MARTY:
And Jimmy's in it, right?

HENRY:
Will you stop.

HENRY:
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.

KAREN:
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.

HENRY:
Hello!  Hello!  Have a good flight?

JUDY:
Where'd you find such creeps?

HENRY:
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?

ROBIN:
Stay there.

HENRY:
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.

ROBIN:
I hate to do dishes.

HENRY:
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.

ROBIN:
So do I.

ROBIN:
Are you okay? What happened?

HENRY:
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.

MARTY:
I want to talk to Jimmy.

HENRY:
He heard.

MARTY:
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.

HENRY:
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.

JIMMY:
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.

HENRY:
Jimmy.

JIMMY:
We did it.  We did it.

JIMMY:
Give'm a drink.

HENRY:
I gotta talk to you.

JIMMY:
Have a drink first.

JIMMY:
Oh yeah? Anything you say.

HENRY:
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?

JIMMY:
Don't worry about it.

HENRY:
There are cops all over the place.

JIMMY:
So what?  Where are they gonna go?

HENRY:
Paulie's gonna make him?

JIMMY:
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.

HENRY:
What'll I tell Fran?

JIMMY:
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.

JIMMY:
Watch this.

HENRY:
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?

JIMMY:
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.

HENRY:
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.

JIMMY:
You want the melon?

HENRY:
Nah.

JIMMY:
I better call again.

HENRY:
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.

JIMMY:
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.

HENRY:
Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.

HENRY:
You ready?

JUDY:
Yeah.

HENRY:
Tell Michael not to 1et the sauce stick.

HENRY:
You know what to do?

JUDY:
Yeah, yeah.

HENRY:
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.

JUDY:
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!

HENRY:
Just make sure you do it. You know what I mean?

ROBIN:
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...

HENRY:
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?

ROBIN:
Okay?

JUDY:
I gotta go home.

HENRY:
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.

JUDY:
I gotta go home and get my hat.

HENRY:
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?

JUDY:
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.

HENRY:
What could I do?  If she insisted, I had to drive her home for her goddamn hat.  I threw the package in the kitchen and went to take her hone.

KAREN:
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.

HENRY:
What did he say, exactly?

KAREN:
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.

HENRY:
Paul will calm down. You'll see.

KAREN:
I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.

HENRY:
Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.

KAREN:
Then you're safer in here.

HENRY:
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.

KAREN:
Who's gonna do that?

HENRY:
Just get me out.

HENRY:
So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.

HENRY:
Where's the stuff?

KAREN:
What are you talking about?

HENRY:
You know. The stuff I left.

KAREN:
I flushed it down the toilet.

HENRY:
You what?

KAREN:
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.

HENRY:
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.

KAREN:
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.

HENRY:
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?

KAREN:
Oh no! No!  Noooo!

VARIO:
I warned you a million times.

HENRY:
I've been all fucked up since I got out.

VARIO:
You think I didn't know what you were doing?

HENRY:
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.

VARIO:
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.

HENRY:
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...

VARIO:
You thought I was some fucking jerk?

HENRY:
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.

HENRY:
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.

VARIO:
You treated me like shit.

VARIO:
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.

HENRY:
Thirtytwo hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirtytwo hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.

JIMMY:
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?

KAREN:
He's okay. They sobered him up.

JIMMY:
Did he say what they're asking him about?

KAREN:
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.

JIMMY:
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.

KAREN:
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.

JIMMY:
I know. I know. But it'll be okay. Don't worry. I got some money for you. It's down the block.

JIMMY:
The third store down.

KAREN:
Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.

HENRY:
What happened? You okay?

KAREN:
I got seared.

HENRY:
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.

KAREN:
I got scared.

HENRY:
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.

HENRY:
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.

JIMMY:
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.

HENRY:
How?

JIMMY:
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.

HENRY:
Yeah.

JIMMY:
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.

HENRY:
Yeah.

JIMMY:
I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case.

MCDONALD:
We'll pack up everything and send it to you.

KAREN:
I got dry cleaning.

MCDONALD:
We'll pick it up.

KAREN:
What about the schools?

HENRY:
Yeah. What about the kids' school?

MCDONALD:
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.

KAREN:
I don't want them left back.

MCDONALD:
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.

KAREN:
That's important.

DESMOND:
Yes...

COLE:
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.

DESMOND:
OK, Gordon.

COLE:
NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET.

DESMOND:
OK, Gordon.

COLE:
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.

DESMOND:
Okay, Gordon!!!

COLE:
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.

DESMOND:
Smell something fishy, huh?

COLE:
I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU, CHET. SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU. ARRANGEMENTS ARE BEING MADE AND I WILL MEET YOU AT THE PORTLAND, AIRPORT.

DESMOND:
Congratulations. I heard about that.

COLE:
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.

COLE:
GOOD LUCK, CHET.  SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI.  YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICES. I AM FLYING OUT TODAY.

DESMOND:
Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.

STANLEY:
That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?

DESMOND:
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.

STANLEY:
Code, I've heard a lot about this.

DESMOND:
Sort of shorthand.

STANLEY:
Shorthand. Really?

DESMOND:
We're heading into a difficult situation.

STANLEY:
How do you figure?

DESMOND:
I'll explain it to you. Do you remember Lil's dance?

DESMOND:
Lil was wearing a sour face.

STANLEY:
What do you mean?

DESMOND:
Her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. They are not going to be receptive to the FBI.

STANLEY:
Oh, the uncle is missing.

DESMOND:
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.

STANLEY:
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.

DESMOND:
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?

STANLEY:
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.

DESMOND:
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?

STANLEY:
A blue rose.

DESMOND:
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.

STANLEY:
What did Gordon's tie mean?

DESMOND:
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.

STANLEY:
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?

DESMOND:
He talks loud. And he loves his code.

STANLEY:
I see. He does talk loud.

DESMOND:
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.

STANLEY:
It must be a high priority situation.

DESMOND:
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.

CLIFF:
Oh.

DESMOND:
I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.

CABLE:
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a J. Edgar coming up I think I said, So what?

DESMOND:
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.

CABLE:
You're lucky I am not wasting you.

DESMOND:
Well, little fella, let me put it this way. The operative word here would be Federal. With or without the semantics of all this, I am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased.

CABLE:
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.

DESMOND:
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?

CABLE:
Out back in our morgue.

CABLE:
It's 430. We close at five.

DESMOND:
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.

STANLEY:
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.

DESMOND:
That's what I heard.

STANLEY:
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.

DESMOND:
That's good.

STANLEY:
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?

DESMOND:
I don't know, Sam.

STANLEY:
Maybe, later we could take a look.

DESMOND:
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.

STANLEY:
Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.

DESMOND:
Cole said she was 17.

STANLEY:
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.

DESMOND:
Oh.

DESMOND:
Accidental?

STANLEY:
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.

DESMOND:
What is it?

STANLEY:
It is a piece of paper with the letter T imprinted on it. Take a look.

STANLEY:
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's threethirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?

DESMOND:
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.

STANLEY:
Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?

JACK:
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.

DESMOND:
Where's Hap?

JACK:
He's dead  good and dead.

DESMOND:
Sorry to hear it.

JACK:
He didn't suffer.

DESMOND:
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks

JACK:
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.

DESMOND:
Any friends?

JACK:
No.

DESMOND:
Ever see her with someone else?

JACK:
No.

DESMOND:
Did she ever mention any friends?

JACK:
No.  Ask Irene over there.

IRENE:
Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place  you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?

DESMOND:
How come Jack let's you work here?

IRENE:
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.

DESMOND:
Say no more.

DESMOND:
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?

IRENE:
She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with 

IRENE:
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.

DESMOND:
What happened to her?

IRENE:
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.

DESMOND:
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?

IRENE:
No.

DESMOND:
Do you take cocaine, Irene?

IRENE:
No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.

DESMOND:
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?

IRENE:
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a freak accident.

DESMOND:
Thanks.

STANLEY:
Agent Desmond, it's...

DESMOND:
It's late, Sam.

STANLEY:
It's not late, it's early. Really early.

IRENE:
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.

DESMOND:
What do you mean?

IRENE:
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.

DESMOND:
Thanks.

STANLEY:
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.

DESMOND:
I think that's a good idea.

DESMOND:
I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.

STANLEY:
Are you speaking to me in a code?

DESMOND:
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.

STANLEY:
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.

DESMOND:
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.

CARL:
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.

CARL:
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.

DESMOND:
Did she have someone with her?

CARL:
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.

DESMOND:
Was there an argument?

CARL:
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?

DESMOND:
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?

CARL:
No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff NotQuite Able... Here's the trailer now.

STANLEY:
She lived alone.

DESMOND:
She must have known someone.

DESMOND:
You better dust this place, Sam.

STANLEY:
I'll get my kit.

DESMOND:
Take a look at this.

STANLEY:
She's wearing a ring.

DESMOND:
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.

STANLEY:
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.

DESMOND:
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the fortyeight hour blend.

CARL:
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.

DESMOND:
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?

CLIFF:
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?

DESMOND:
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?

CLIFF:
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.

DESMOND:
Did you know Teresa Banks?

CLIFF:
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.

DESMOND:
No you couldn't.

DESMOND:
Is there a golf course around here?

CARL:
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.

DESMOND:
Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.

CARL:
That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.

STANLEY:
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?

DESMOND:
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.

STANLEY:
Yes, he is like a clown.

CABLE:
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.

DESMOND:
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.

CABLE:
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.

DESMOND:
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?

CABLE:
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.

DESMOND:
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?

CABLE:
My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel.

STANLEY:
When he says, Discussion, how do you take that, Agent Desmond?

DESMOND:
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.

CLIFF:
You try that you little monkey.

DESMOND:
I think I'll take off my badge as well.

STANLEY:
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?

DESMOND:
Faulty wiring.

STANLEY:
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.

DESMOND:
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.

STANLEY:
We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?

COOPER:
What is it, Gordon?

COLE:
COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.

STANLEY:
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.

COOPER:
Anything else?

STANLEY:
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?

COOPER:
I'm up to speed, Stanley.

STANLEY:
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.

COOPER:
And neither will I.

STANLEY:
Oh, alright.  You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.

STANLEY:
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.

COOPER:
Stanley, I heard all about it.

STANLEY:
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.

COOPER:
Tell me about the letter.

STANLEY:
Take a look at this. Chet and I found it under Teresa Banks' ring fingernail.

COOPER:
And no one found the ring?

STANLEY:
No, sir, we did not.

CARL:
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.

COOPER:
Thank you, Carl.

CARL:
That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.

COOPER:
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.

CARL:
Well, where are you going?

COOPER:
I am going over here.

CARL:
God damn, you people are confusing.

COOPER:
What was here, Mr. Rodd?

CARL:
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?

COOPER:
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?

CARL:
An old woman and her grandson.

COOPER:
Can you tell me what their names were?

CARL:
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.

COOPER:
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?

CARL:
Yep, it sure is.

COOPER:
Phillip?

COLE:
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.

COLE:
HE'S GONE.

COOPER:
What?

COLE:
ALBERT, COME BACK HERE. HE'S GONE CALL THE FRONT DESK.

COLE:
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?

COOPER:
Teresa Banks.

COLE:
ALBERT?

COOPER:
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.

COLE:
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?

LAURA:
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.

DONNA:
You didn't do your homework?

LAURA:
Noooo...

DONNA:
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...

LAURA:
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.

DONNA:
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.

LAURA:
Thanks.

DONNA:
James called me last night looking for you.

LAURA:
When?

DONNA:
The usual, 915.

LAURA:
He probably wanted to drive over.

DONNA:
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?

LAURA:
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.

DONNA:
Are you going to tell him about that someone else?

LAURA:
I don't know what to do.

DONNA:
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...

LAURA:
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.

DONNA:
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.

LAURA:
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.

LAURA:
James...

JAMES:
Laura, I'll meet you at 230 after phys. ed.

LAURA:
Okay.

JAMES:
Laura, do you love me?

LAURA:
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.

JAMES:
Why? It does.

LAURA:
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.

JAMES:
It does matter. We're in love.

LAURA:
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.

JAMES:
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.

LAURA:
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

BOBBY:
Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?

LAURA:
I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.

BOBBY:
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?

LAURA:
Get lost Bobby.

BOBBY:
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.

LAURA:
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.

DONNA:
Are you going to see James tonight?

LAURA:
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.

DONNA:
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?

LAURA:
Maybe.

DONNA:
Oh god, Laura.

LAURA:
Well, why not?

DONNA:
Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon.  James is the one.  He loves you with that lasting love... true love.

LAURA:
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?

DONNA:
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.

LAURA:
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.

DONNA:
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?

LAURA:
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.

DONNA:
Maybe I better start our homework.

LAURA:
Okay, I suppose I should go home.

DONNA:
Call me.

LAURA:
Sure. What do you want me to call you?

DONNA:
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.

LAURA:
Can I take the car?

SARAH:
Sure honey, what's the hurry?

LAURA:
I forgot my books at school.

SARAH:
Laura.

LAURA:
What?

LAURA:
My secret diary. There are pages missing.

HAROLD:
Who would do that?

LAURA:
Bob.

HAROLD:
But Bob isn't real.

LAURA:
The pages are gone. That's real.

HAROLD:
Maybe.

LAURA:
Bob is real. He's been having me since I was 12.

LAURA:
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.

HAROLD:
What does Bob say?

LAURA:
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.

HAROLD:
No... No...

LAURA:
Oh, yes... yes...

LAURA:
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.

HAROLD:
Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.

LAURA:
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.

HAROLD:
But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.

HAROLD:
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.

LAURA:
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.

HAROLD:
I'm so sorry, Laura.

SARAH:
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.

LAURA:
What were you doing in my room?

SARAH:
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?

LAURA:
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.

SARAH:
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.

LAURA:
I'm sorry, Mom.

SARAH:
Now hurry, dinner's almost ready. Your father says he's starving.

LELAND:
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  I'm hungry.

SARAH:
Oh, Leland.

LAURA:
Dad.

LELAND:
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.

LELAND:
The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, Hello, my name is Leland Palmer.

LAURA:
But my name isn't Leland Palmer.

SARAH:
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.

LELAND:
This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.

ALBERT:
Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?

COOPER:
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.

ALBERT:
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?

COOPER:
Albert.

ALBERT:
You said, Teresa Banks, so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?

COOPER:
Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.

ALBERT:
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?

COOPER:
A woman.

ALBERT:
What color hair will she have?

COOPER:
Blonde.

ALBERT:
Tell me some other things about her.

COOPER:
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.

ALBERT:
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?

COOPER:
She is preparing a great abundance of food.

NORMA:
Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the Meals on Wheels?

SHELLY:
I'm kind of busy, Norma.

NORMA:
You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.

SHELLY:
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?

NORMA:
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.

SHELLY:
You're right. There's no one here.

NORMA:
There's no one here.

SHELLY:
Norma, are you alright?

NORMA:
Come back as soon as you can.

SHELLY:
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the Meals on Wheels.

NORMA:
Don't worry, Shelly, I'll handle Leo.

DONNA:
Laura?

LAURA:
Donna, are you my best friend?

DONNA:
Of course...

DONNA:
What is it Laura? What's wrong?

LAURA:
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...

DONNA:
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?

LAURA:
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.

DONNA:
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.

LAURA:
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.

DONNA:
Do you want to talk?

LAURA:
No, I want to smoke.

DONNA:
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?

LAURA:
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.

DONNA:
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?

LAURA:
If I can smoke it.

DONNA:
You want a muffin?

LAURA:
Donna, you are a muffin.

DONNA:
Goodbye, Muffin.

LAURA:
No, you're the muffin.

LELAND:
Hi, honey, how's Donna?

LAURA:
Fine.

LELAND:
School?

LAURA:
...school's fine...

LELAND:
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?

LAURA:
Not really.

LELAND:
Let me see.

LAURA:
Dad...

LELAND:
Your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail.

SARAH:
Leland, what are you doing?

LELAND:
Look at this finger here.

SARAH:
Leland...

LELAND:
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.

LELAND:
Did you get this from your lover?

SARAH:
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.

LELAND:
Bobby didn't give you this?

SARAH:
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?

LELAND:
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?

SARAH:
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.

LELAND:
How do you know what she doesn't like?

SARAH:
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.

LELAND:
Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.

JAMES:
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.

LAURA:
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.

JAMES:
We were supposed to be together.

LAURA:
How can I be together if I'm not together?

JAMES:
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?

LAURA:
James...

JAMES:
When am I going to see you?

LELAND:
Who was that?

LAURA:
A friend from school.

LELAND:
A special friend?

LAURA:
No... No, go away.

BOB'S VOICE:
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.

LAURA:
Go away. I am not talking to you.

BOB'S VOICE:
I want you.

SARAH:
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?

LAURA:
Mom... what are you wearing?

SARAH:
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.

LAURA:
Mom, take it easy.

LEO:
Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.

SHELLY:
Lay off the bennies, Leo.

LEO:
Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface.  WHERE THE DIRT IS, SHELLY.

LEO:
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly,  HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.

SHELLY:
As if I didn't know.

LEO:
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.

SHELLY:
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...

LEO:
What did you say?

DONNA:
Where are you going?

LAURA:
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.

DONNA:
Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.

LAURA:
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?

DONNA:
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?

DONNA:
Where are the Cookies?

LAURA:
You mean Fred and Ginger?

DONNA:
Dancing.

DONNA:
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.

LAURA:
Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.

DONNA:
What are you doing?

LAURA:
Nothing.

DONNA:
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.

LAURA:
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!

JACQUES:
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.

LAURA:
Hey, Jacques...

JACQUES:
No Jacques. I am the Great Went.

LAURA:
I am The Muffin.

JACQUES:
And what a muffin you have.

JACQUES:
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...

LAURA:
What? She asked about my father?

JACQUES:
But it wasn't him... she was after a huge guy, six foot four with a broken nose. She said he looked just like a boxer. Speaking of sandwiches... I think Bobby was arranging something for you...  Speaking of arrangements...  SPEAKING OF ARRANGEMENTS... Why don't you two come up to the cabin this week? Leo and I know that Santy Claus is coming to town... Thursday.

BOB'S VOICE:
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?

LAURA:
NO! GOD, NO...

LAURA:
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.

DONNA:
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?

LAURA:
Jacques, help me get her home. NOW!

DONNA:
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.

LAURA:
Not you, Donna, not you.

TRUMAN:
Josie, I think we should go public.

JOSIE:
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.

TRUMAN:
What are you afraid of? What people think?

JOSIE:
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.

TRUMAN:
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.

JOSIE:
Fish eyes?

TRUMAN:
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.

JOSIE:
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?

TRUMAN:
I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle. He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. His throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. And he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver. I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. Splat! It just stuck up there and spread out. It was about the size of a half dollar. And that's why I don't ever eat fish eyes.

TRUMAN:
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.

JOSIE:
I understand.

TRUMAN:
We throw away the whole head.

DONNA:
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?

LAURA:
No, you should forget about last night.

DONNA:
Laura, I am your friend.

LAURA:
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.

DONNA:
You're not mad at me?

LAURA:
No.

DONNA:
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.

LAURA:
What can I tell you?

DONNA:
How did the car get back here?

LAURA:
WE got it back, that's all.

DONNA:
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?

LAURA:
I can't help you there.

DONNA:
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?

LAURA:
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.

DONNA:
But I love you, Laura.

LAURA:
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.

DONNA:
Why do you do it, Laura?

LAURA:
Cause I like it.

TERESA:
When's the next business trip, big fella?

LELAND:
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?

TERESA:
I can arrange that. I like that.

TERESA:
What are you doing?

LELAND:
Who am I?

TERESA:
I don't know.

LELAND:
That's right.

LAURA:
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?

LELAND:
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?

LAURA:
No.

LELAND:
We're late to get to your mother.

LAURA:
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.

LELAND:
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?

TERESA:
What's wrong?

LELAND:
Nothing, I chickened out.

LAURA:
Are you sure you're okay?

LELAND:
Yes.

LAURA:
Dad?

LELAND:
Yes.

LAURA:
Did you come home during the day last week?

LELAND:
No.

LAURA:
Oh, I thought I saw you.

LELAND:
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?

LAURA:
I was down the street.

BOB'S VOICE:
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.

LAURA:
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?

BOB'S VOICE:
I am the One who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.

LAURA:
I'm nearly out.

BOBBY:
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.

LAURA:
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?

BOBBY:
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 1100.

LAURA:
Don't be late.

JAMES:
I've got to see you.

LAURA:
Not now.

JAMES:
This afternoon?

LAURA:
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.

JAMES:
What about tonight?

LAURA:
I can't tonight.

JAMES:
What's going on?

LAURA:
I just can't, James. I can't do it.

JERRY:
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?

LELAND:
Boating?

JERRY:
No.

LELAND:
Hiking?

JERRY:
No.

LELAND:
Eating?

JERRY:
You'd think so.

LELAND:
Sex?

JERRY:
You're getting warmer.

LELAND:
Trees?

JERRY:
Exactment. They are nuts about wood. They get goofy over trees.

JERRY:
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.

LELAND:
They were looking for wood.

ED:
Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.

PETE:
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big E starin' at me.

ED:
You know what that Big E stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.

PETE:
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.

ED:
What'll it be?

PETE:
Fill 'er up.

ED:
You got it.

PETE:
I haven't got it yet.

ED:
Nice night.

PETE:
Yep...  Yes...  It is.

PETE:
You missed somethin', Ed.

ED:
I did? I didn't see anything.

PETE:
Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.

PETE:
Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.

ED:
Brother, I hear you talkin'.

BOBBY:
Here he comes.

LAURA:
Here he comes.

BOBBY:
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?

LAURA:
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.

LAURA:
No.

BOB'S VOICE:
I want you to kill for me.

LAURA:
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.

BOB'S VOICE:
I want you to kill for me.

BOBBY:
Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.

LAURA:
You killed Mike.

JACOBY:
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.

LAURA:
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.

JACOBY:
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.

LAURA:
I'm not.

JACOBY:
Did you make me a tape?

LAURA:
I already made you two tapes.

JACOBY:
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.

LAURA:
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.

JACOBY:
Send me a kiss.

LELAND:
Laura. What's wrong this morning?

LAURA:
Stay away from me.

LAURA:
I hate asparagus.

SARAH:
Sure you do, it's good for you.

LAURA:
Where's Dad?

SARAH:
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.

LAURA:
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.

SARAH:
It's a school night... back by nine.

BOBBY:
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.

LAURA:
What was?

BOBBY:
The stuff we got last night.

LAURA:
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.

BOBBY:
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.

LAURA:
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?

BOBBY:
Don't get funny with me again.

LAURA:
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.

BOBBY:
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.

LAURA:
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.

BOBBY:
Let's ditch this place and party.

LAURA:
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.

BOBBY:
Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?

BOBBY:
We can do it right here.

LAURA:
Bobby...

BOBBY:
Bobby's got it.

LAURA:
Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.

LAURA:
Good night, Mom.

SARAH:
Good night, sweetheart.

JAMES:
What the hell is wrong with you?

LAURA:
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?

JAMES:
What do you mean?

LAURA:
You know it and I know it.

JAMES:
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.

LAURA:
Everything, but everything.

JAMES:
Oh, Laura.

LAURA:
Oh, Laura...

JAMES:
You always hurt the ones you love.

LAURA:
You mean the ones you pity.

JAMES:
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.

LAURA:
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.

LAURA:
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.

JAMES:
What?

LAURA:
When he finds out.

JAMES:
What?

LAURA:
Bobby killed a guy.

JAMES:
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.

LAURA:
You want to see...

JAMES:
See what?

LAURA:
Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now.

JACQUES:
Right on time, baby.

LAURA:
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.

JACQUES:
We're on our way, Baby.

LAURA:
Let's go all the way.

LELAND:
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.

LAURA:
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.

LELAND:
I always thought you knew it was me.

LAURA:
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.

COOPER:
Where is the ring?

MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE:
Someone else has it now.

COOPER:
That would indicate that it's the future.

MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE:
The later events have never been kept a secret.

COOPER:
Where am I? And how can I leave?

MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE:
You are here and there is no place to go...

HAN:
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?

LUKE:
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read ings.

HAN:
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.

LUKE:
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.

RIEEKAN:
Captain Solo.  What's the situation?

HAN:
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.

RIEEKAN:
Good, and Commander Skywalker?

HAN:
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.

RIEEKAN:
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.

HAN:
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.

HAN:
That's right.

RIEEKAN:
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.

HAN:
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.

RIEEKAN:
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.

HAN:
Yes, Your Highness?

LEIA:
You said you were going to stay. What happened?

HAN:
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.

LEIA:
Does Luke know?

HAN:
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.

LEIA:
Han, we need you here.

HAN:
We?

LEIA:
Yes.

HAN:
Not you?

LEIA:
Me?  I don't know what you mean.

HAN:
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...

LEIA:
And what are they, pray tell?

HAN:
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.

LEIA:
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.

HAN:
Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.

LEIA:
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.

HAN:
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.

LEIA:
We are fighting for a cause much ...

HAN:
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.

LEIA:
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?

HAN:
Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.

THREEPIO:
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?

HAN:
What is it?

THREEPIO:
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.

HAN:
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?

THREEPIO:
She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you.  No one seems to know ...

DECK SERGEANT:
Yes sir!

HAN:
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?

DECK SERGEANT:
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.

HAN:
Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!

THREEPIO:
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?

HAN:
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.

DECK SERGEANT:
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.

HAN:
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?

DECK SERGEANT:
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...

HAN:
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.

DECK SERGEANT:
The temperature is dropping too fast.

HAN:
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.

DECK SERGEANT:
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.

HAN:
Then I'll see you in Hell.

LUKE:
I can't ...

BEN:
You must.  Luke, look at me!

BEN:
You must survive, Luke.

LUKE:
I'm cold ... so cold ...

BEN:
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me  Yoda, the Jedi Master.

LUKE:
Ben ... Ben ...

BEN:
Luke ... you are the only hope.

RIEEKAN:
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.

LEIA:
I understand.

RIEEKAN:
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.

LEIA:
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?

RIEEKAN:
Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much, but ...

HAN:
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.

THREEPIO:
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...

HAN:
The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold.

LEIA:
Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...

HAN:
Forget it.

LEIA:
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.

HAN:
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.

LEIA:
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?

RIEEKAN:
Not yet.  They're working on it now.

RIEEKAN:
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.

LEIA:
What is it?

HAN:
Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.

RIEEKAN:
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.

HAN:
Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.

HAN:
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.

LEIA:
What was it?

HAN:
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a selfdestruct ....

LEIA:
An Imperial probe droid.

HAN:
Now don't panic.  We don't know that.

VADER:
The Hoth System?

PIETT:
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...

LEIA:
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?

LUKE:
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.

LEIA:
Me too.  I was afraid.

LEIA:
You rest now.

THREEPIO:
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.

LEIA:
I'll be back later.

LUKE:
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?

LEIA:
What did you say?!

LEIA:
Where are you going?

LUKE:
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...

LEIA:
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?

LUKE:
What are you talking about?

LEIA:
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...

LUKE:
Han's leaving?

LUKE:
Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.

LEIA:
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.

LUKE:
Jabba the Hutt?

LEIA:
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.

LUKE:
Snow creatures ... they're here?!

HAN:
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.

LUKE:
Thanks to you.

HAN:
That's two you owe me, junior.

HAN:
Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.

LEIA:
I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.

LUKE:
Probe?  What probe?

HAN:
That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.

LEIA:
I don't know what he's talking about.

HAN:
Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.

LUKE:
About what?

HAN:
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.

LEIA:
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.

HAN:
Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?

LEIA:
Why you lowdown, stuckup, half witted, scruffylooking nerfherder.

HAN:
Who's scruffylooking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?

PIETT:
Yes, My Lord.

VADER:
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.

LUKE:
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.

HAN:
Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.

LEIA:
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.

RIEEKAN:
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.

HAN:
Hey!  Someone's still in here.

LEIA:
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.

HAN:
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!

THREEPIO:
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.

LEIA:
Would it help if I got out and pushed?

HAN:
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.

LEIA:
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.

HAN:
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.

LEIA:
I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.

PIETT:
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.

VADER:
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?

PIETT:
It won't get through the blockade.

VADER:
I want that ship.

HAN:
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?

HAN:
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.

LEIA:
I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried.

THREEPIO:
Sir, I was wondering ...

HAN:
Sit down, and shut up!

THREEPIO:
It can wait.

HAN:
I think we're in trouble.

THREEPIO:
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para light system seems to be damaged.

HAN:
We're in trouble!

HAN:
That was no laser blast .... some thing hit us ....

LEIA:
Or you ran into something ....

HAN:
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...

LEIA:
Probably an asteroid field ....

HAN:
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.

LEIA:
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?

HAN:
Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.

LEIA:
You don't have to do this to impress me.

THREEPIO:
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...

ADMIRAL PIETT:
My lord.

VADER:
Come in, Admiral.

ADMIRAL PIETT:
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.

VADER:
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?

ADMIRAL PIETT:
Soon, Lord Vader.

VADER:
Yes, Admiral .... soon.

HAN:
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.

LEIA:
I take it back.

HAN:
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.

LEIA:
Good.

HAN:
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.

LEIA:
I'm against that.

HAN:
We've got to get out of this shower.

LEIA:
Now you're making sense.

HAN:
Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...

THREEPIO:
Closer?!

LEIA:
Closer?!

HAN:
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.

LEIA:
What is it?

HAN:
That should do nicely.

ADMIRAL:
It was .... the Emperor ....

VADER:
The Emperor?

ADMIRAL:
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....

VADER:
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.

ADMIRAL:
Yes, My Lord.

VADER:
And code the signal to my private chamber.

HAN:
What are you so grouchy about?

THREEPIO:
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?

LEIA:
A tremor!

THREEPIO:
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.

HAN:
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.

LEIA:
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.

HAN:
You don't look angry.

LEIA:
How do I look?

HAN:
Beautiful.

LEIA:
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.

HAN:
Well, I hope you don't expect more.

LEIA:
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.

HAN:
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.

HAN:
You, too, golden rod.

THREEPIO:
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.

LUKE:
... Like we're being watched.

CREATURE:
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.

LUKE:
I'm looking for someone.

CREATURE:
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!

LUKE:
Yeah ...

CREATURE:
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.

LUKE:
I'm looking for a great warrior.

CREATURE:
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.

LUKE:
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...

CREATURE:
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?

LUKE:
Give me that!

CREATURE:
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.

LUKE:
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.

CREATURE:
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.

CREATURE:
Mine, mine.

LUKE:
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.

CREATURE:
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.

LUKE:
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.

CREATURE:
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.

LUKE:
You know the Jedi Master?

CREATURE:
Of course, yes.  But now eat we must.  Good food, I have good food.  Come, come.

HAN:
That was no earthquake.

LEIA:
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.

LEIA:
They're moving away.

HAN:
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.

LEIA:
Where have I heard that before?

HAN:
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.

LEIA:
Would you please stop calling me that?

HAN:
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.

LEIA:
Yes, you do.

HAN:
You could be a touch warmer, though.  Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right.

LEIA:
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.

HAN:
That's quite a compliment.

LEIA:
Stop that.

HAN:
Why?

HAN:
What are you afraid of?

LEIA:
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.

LEIA:
Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.

HAN:
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.

LEIA:
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.

HAN:
You mean a man you can control.

LEIA:
I do not!

HAN:
Try and control this ...

LUKE:
... I told you, I'm not hungry.

CREATURE:
Patience.  It's time to eat.

LUKE:
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.

CREATURE:
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.

LUKE:
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?

CREATURE:
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?

LUKE:
Because of my father, I guess.

CREATURE:
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.

LUKE:
How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?

BEN:
He will learn patience.

YODA:
Much anger in him, like in his father.

BEN:
We've discussed this before.

YODA:
Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.

LUKE:
Why not me?

YODA:
To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.

BEN:
He can do it.

YODA:
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!

LUKE:
I have followed my feelings.

YODA:
You are reckless!

BEN:
He'll learn.

YODA:
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.

YODA:
Will he finish what he begins?

BEN:
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.

LUKE:
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.

YODA:
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.

VADER:
What is thy bidding, My Master?

EMPEROR:
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.

VADER:
I have felt it.

EMPEROR:
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.

VADER:
Our destruction?  Who?

EMPEROR:
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.

VADER:
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obiwan could not have taught him so much that ...

EMPEROR:
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.

VADER:
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.

EMPEROR:
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.

VADER:
He will join us or die, My Master.

LEIA:
There's something out there!

HAN:
Where?

LEIA:
Outside, in the cave.

THREEPIO:
It sounds like it's trying to get in.

HAN:
I'm going to see what it is.

LEIA:
Are you crazy!

HAN:
Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...

LEIA:
Looks like some kind of Mynock.

HAN:
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.

LEIA:
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.

HAN:
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!

LEIA:
But the tremors have stopped.

HAN:
I see it Chewie, hang on.

LEIA:
The entrance is collapsing!

THREEPIO:
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...

HAN:
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...

LEIA:
What??

THREEPIO:
Oh my, no!

YODA:
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.

LUKE:
I thought I was in good shape.

YODA:
Yes, but by what standard, ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.

LUKE:
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.

YODA:
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.

LUKE:
Okay.  I'll give it a try.

YODA:
No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.

LUKE:
I can't. It's too big.

YODA:
Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?

LUKE:
I don't believe it.

YODA:
That is why you fail.

THREEPIO:
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.

HAN:
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.

HAN:
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.

LEIA:
No lightspeed?

HAN:
It's not my fault.  I can't under stand it!

THREEPIO:
Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.

LEIA:
Well, what now?

HAN:
Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.

LEIA:
You're going to attack them?!!!

YODA:
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.

LUKE:
I thought those seekers were set for stun!

YODA:
That they are.

LUKE:
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.

YODA:
That would matter not were The Force flowing through you.  Higher you'd jump!  Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.

YODA:
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.

LUKE:
But I feel The Force flowing!

YODA:
Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.

LUKE:
Price?  What do you mean?

YODA:
The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obiwan's apprentice.

LUKE:
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?

YODA:
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.

LUKE:
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?

YODA:
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.

LUKE:
But tell me why ...

YODA:
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...

ADMIRAL PIETT:
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.

VADER:
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!

ADMIRAL PIETT:
Yes, My Lord.  We'll find them.

LEIA:
You could have warned him before you shut him off.

HAN:
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?

LEIA:
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.

HAN:
Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.

LEIA:
What'd you have in mind for your next move?

HAN:
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.

LEIA:
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?

HAN:
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?

LEIA:
That depends.  Where are we?

HAN:
Here ... near the Anoat system.

HAN:
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.

LEIA:
You keep logs?  My, how organized.

HAN:
Well, sometimes ... Ahhah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.

LEIA:
Never heard of that system.

HAN:
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, conartist ... all around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.

LEIA:
A mining colony.

HAN:
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.

LEIA:
Can you trust him?

HAN:
No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...

LEIA:
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.

HAN:
Let er go, Chewie.

YODA:
Four this time!  The Force you feel.

LUKE:
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.

LUKE:
I feel cold.

YODA:
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.

LUKE:
What's in there?

YODA:
Only what you take with you.

THREEPIO:
Rather touchy, aren't they.

LEIA:
I thought you knew this person.

HAN:
Well, it's been awhile.

CHEWIE:
Barks and growls at his boss.

HAN:
That was a long time ago.  I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you.

LEIA:
I don't like this.

HAN:
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.

LANDO:
Why you slimy, doublecrossing nogood swindler ... am I glad to see you.

HAN:
No hard feelings?

LANDO:
Are you kidding?

HAN:
I always said you were a gentleman.

LANDO:
I'll bet.

LANDO:
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?

CHEWIE:
Growls a reserved greeting.

LANDO:
Right.

LANDO:
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?

LEIA:
You may call me Leia.

LANDO:
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?

HAN:
Repairs ...

LANDO:
What have you done to my ship?

LANDO:
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?

HAN:
Hyperdrive.

LANDO:
I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.

HAN:
How's your mining operation going?

LANDO:
Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?

HAN:
Nothing.  I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon sible leader and businessman ... But you wear it well.

LUKE:
Ben?  Ben?

YODA:
Free your mind and return he will.

LUKE:
My mind fills with so many images.

YODA:
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.

LUKE:
I see a city in the clouds.

YODA:
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.

LUKE:
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.

YODA:
It is the future you see.

LUKE:
Will they die?

YODA:
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!

LUKE:
They're my friends.

YODA:
Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.

LEIA:
What are you staring at?

HAN:
Who's staring?

LEIA:
You look silly.

HAN:
You look great.

LEIA:
Has Threepio turned up yet?

HAN:
Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.

LEIA:
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.

HAN:
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.

CHEWIE:
Barks at his master.

LEIA:
What happened?

HAN:
He found him in a junk pile ...

LEIA:
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.

HAN:
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.

LEIA:
Chewie, do you think you can repair him?

CHEWIE:
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.

HAN:
Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?

LEIA:
No thanks.

HAN:
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...

LANDO:
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?

LEIA:
Not really.

LANDO:
I must say, your beauty is unpar alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.

LEIA:
Thanks.

LANDO:
Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?

CHEWIE:
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.

LANDO:
Everyone's invited, of course.

LANDO:
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.

LEIA:
You're part of the mining guild then?

LANDO:
Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial.

LEIA:
It's a lovely outpost.

LANDO:
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.

CHEWIE:
Barks at Han.

HAN:
Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?

LANDO:
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.

HAN:
I'm sorry too.

BEN:
... Luke, you must not go.

LUKE:
But Han and Leia will surely die.

BEN:
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.

LUKE:
I can help them!

BEN:
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.

LUKE:
I feel The Force.

BEN:
But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.

YODA:
Yes, yes.  To Obiwan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?

LUKE:
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.

BEN:
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.

LUKE:
And that is why I must go.

BEN:
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.

LUKE:
You won't.

BEN:
Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with The Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path ... as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate, despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now.

YODA:
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.

BEN:
You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.

LUKE:
And sacrifice Han and Leia?

YODA:
If it must be.  Yes.

BEN:
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.

YODA:
Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.

YODA:
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.

BEN:
The boy is our last hope.

YODA:
No ... there is another.

LANDO:
What about Leia and the Wookiee?

VADER:
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.

LANDO:
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.

VADER:
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.

LANDO:
No.

VADER:
Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.

CHEWIE:
Barks his concern.

HAN:
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.

HAN:
I was worried about you.

LEIA:
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.

HAN:
Me either.  They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions.

HAN:
Get out of here, Lando!

LANDO:
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.

HAN:
This ought to be good.

LANDO:
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.

LEIA:
What about Han?

LANDO:
I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.

HAN:
You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.

LANDO:
He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.

HAN:
Luke?  I don't get it.

LANDO:
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...

LEIA:
... we're the bait.

HAN:
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?

LANDO:
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.

LANDO:
Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...

HAN:
Yeah, you're a real hero.

LANDO:
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.

VADER:
I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.

CHEWIE:
Barks a doleful farewell.

HAN:
I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.

LEIA:
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.

HAN:
... just remember that, cause I'll be back ...

LANDO:
I'll take what's mine now.

VADER:
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.

LANDO:
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in

VADER:
I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.

LUKE:
Leia!

LEIA:
Luke, no!  It's a trap.

LEIA:
What's going on?

LANDO:
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.

LEIA:
And when do you betray us again?

LANDO:
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.

LEIA:
We have no use for your kind.

LANDO:
This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.

CHEWIE:
Barks a blue streak.

LANDO:
What's wrong with him?

LEIA:
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.

LANDO:
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.

VADER:
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.

LUKE:
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

VADER:
And I too.

VADER:
Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obiwan knew this to be true.

LUKE:
No!

VADER:
There is much Obiwan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.

LUKE:
I'll die first.

VADER:
That won't be necessary.

VADER:
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.

LUKE:
Time will tell.

LEIA:
We should have stayed and finished them off.

CHEWIE:
Barks his agreement.

LEIA:
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.

CHEWIE:
Barks his right on!

LANDO:
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.

LEIA:
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.

LANDO:
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.

LEIA:
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...

LEIA:
... the power?

CHEWIE:
Howls.

LEIA:
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.

LANDO:
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.

LEIA:
We've got to find Luke.

LANDO:
His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.

VADER:
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.

LUKE:
No! .... Never ....

VADER:
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!

LUKE:
Never.

THREEPIO:
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...

LEIA:
Let's go.

LEIA:
What'd you say?

LANDO:
I didn't say anything?

LANDO:
I knew that setup was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.

LEIA:
Luke!

LANDO:
What?

LEIA:
Luke needs help.  We must go back.

CHEWIE:
Barks his consternation.

LEIA:
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.

LANDO:
Three patrol ships are heading our way.

CHEWIE:
Barks an argument and shakes his head.

LEIA:
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!

LANDO:
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.

CHEWIE:
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.

LANDO:
Okay, okay.

LANDO:
Someone's falling.

LEIA:
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.

LEIA:
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?

LUKE:
He'll survive.

CHEWIE:
Howls.

LANDO:
We're not out of this yet.

LANDO:
The deflector shields are gone.

LEIA:
Are the coordinates set?

LEIA:
This hyperdrive had better work.

LUKE:
I've never seen it fail.

LANDO:
I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.

LEIA:
That sounds familiar.

LEIA:
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.

CHEWIE:
Barks his agreement.
